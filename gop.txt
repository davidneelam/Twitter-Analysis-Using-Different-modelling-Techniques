@realDonaldTrump The more than 30 MILLION small businesses in America are the backbone of our nation—and this pandemic has hit them hard.   That's why @realDonaldTrump's #PaycheckProtectionProgram is the lifeline these businesses—and the Americans they employ—need in these unpredictable times.
@realDonaldTrump The #PaycheckProtectionProgram is a forgivable loan.   If the employer maintains its payroll, then the portion of the PPP loan used would be forgiven.  These grants are retroactive to Feb. 15, 2020—which will help bring workers who have already been laid off back onto payrolls.
.@realDonaldTrump's #PaycheckProtectionProgram (PPP) is a lifeline for small businesses during this time of uncertainty.   It is a ~$350 billion program to provide eight weeks of cash-flow assistance to small businesses that maintain their payroll.

.@realDonaldTrump is making education a priority!   In 2019, the Trump Admin. once again renewed its commitment to school choice, proposing a $5 billion per year tax credit on donations that fund scholarships for private schools, apprenticeships, &amp; other programs.  #DemDebate

President Trump successfully passed bipartisan criminal justice reforms by making the issue a top priority in his administration.   Thanks to The First Step Act, more than 3,000 Americans have been released from prison, giving inmates a second chance in life.  #DemDebate
.@realDonaldTrump has delivered on his #PromisesMade to the black community.  As a result of the First Step Act—signed into law by Pres. Trump—more than 3,000 Americans have been released from prison.  90% of those who had their sentences reduced are black Americans.  #DemDebate
Throughout the Trump Administration,  Americans have seen RECORD LOW unemployment!   In January: 💥Black American unemployment—6% 💥Hispanic American unemployment—4.3% 💥Asian American unemployment—3%   ALL Americans are benefitting from the @realDonaldTrump economy.  #DemDebate
2020 Dems' remarks about wage growth need a reality check.   The truth: Under Pres. Trump, wage growth for low-wage workers is outpacing overall gains.   And for 23 consecutive months, wage growth has been near or above 3%.  #DemDebate
There are no moderates in this field of Democrat candidates.  ALL 2020 Dems endorse a radical big-gov't socialist agenda that is out of touch with Americans.

Democrats’ agenda is wildly out of touch with Nevada voters.   👎In Nevada, Bernie Sanders’ government takeover of health care would kick over 1.6 MILLION Nevadans off their private insurance.   👎The Green New Deal—which every 2020 Dem supports—would devastate NV’s economy.

While 2020 Dems propose radical agendas that increase gov't control over nearly every aspect of American lives, Pres. Trump is enacting policies that actually WORK.  Under @realDonaldTrump, over 12,000 Nevadans have been lifted out of poverty &amp; almost 25,000 are off food stamps💪
Under @realDonaldTrump, the unemployment rate in Nevada has decreased from 5.4% to 3.8%—tied for a RECORD low.   The #GOPTaxCuts have bolstered Nevada workers &amp; families. The tax reform resulted in nearly 2,000 new jobs and an average tax cut of $1,341.

2020 Democrats’ radical immigration agenda is wildly out of touch with Colorado voters.  Their plan would enact: —open borders —abolishing ICE —sanctuary cities  The 2020 Democrat agenda puts Coloradans' safety at risk AND takes away more of taxpayers' hard-earned money.

Under @realDonaldTrump, the unemployment rate in Colorado has decreased from 2.9% to 2.5%.  Under the Obama/Biden Administration, the unemployment rate in the Centennial State was more than DOUBLE what it is today.

Joe Biden started the Democrat race claiming to be a moderate, but he has adopted fringe far-left policy proposals throughout this primary.    He now supports: ❌Taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants ❌The job killing &amp; tax increasing Green New Deal  #DemDebate
The radical policies 2020 Dems propose would devastate AZ's economy &amp; way of life. 👎The #GreenNewDeal—which every 2020 Dem supports—would kill jobs &amp; raise taxes. 👎Bernie Sanders’ gov't takeover of health care would kick ~3.4 MILLION Arizonans off their private insurance.  #KAG
Wages are rising, &amp; our national unemployment rate is at 3.6%—a near-generational low!  During tonight's Debate, 2020 Democrats won't mention all the GOOD @realDonaldTrump is doing for Americans &amp; all the GOOD American families can do with more money in their pockets!  #DemDebate
2020 Democrats’ agenda is wildly out of touch with Arizona voters.   Their radical immigration plan calls for: 🚫open borders 🚫abolishing ICE 🚫sanctuary cities  Pres. Trump is securing our border—his negotiations led to border apprehensions falling 70% May to Nov. 2019.  #KAG

While 2020 Dems are proposing radical policies that increase government control over nearly every aspect of Arizonans' lives, @realDonaldTrump is actually WORKING for the people.  Pres. Trump’s policies have lifted 124,000 Arizonans out of poverty &amp; 147,000 off food stamps!  #KAG
REMINDER: 2020 Democrats have a job killing climate agenda that jeopardizes 10.3 million jobs across the country, including almost 45,000 jobs in The Silver State.  #DemDebate
Bloomberg’s radical climate policies could make even the far-left socialists blush.  His war on coal and natural gas is perhaps the most aggressive of any 2020 Democrats, and he gleefully touts proposals that would jeopardize 10.3 million jobs across the country.  #DemDebate
2020 Dems claim that Pres. Trump isn't taking care of our environment.   But he proposed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule &amp; permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  He's also announced that the U.S. will join the 1 trillion trees initiative.  #DemDebate

Arizona's economy is HOT under @realDonaldTrump: 🔥Since Pres. Trump's election, the AZ economy has added 240K jobs—19K of them manufacturing. 🔥The unemployment rate in AZ has gone from 5.2% to 4.6%. 🔥The #GOPTaxCuts created ~4,000 new jobs &amp; an average tax cut of $1,354.  #KAG

While 2020 Dems push their government takeover of health care—Pres. Trump is working w/ Congress to fix our broken system &amp; implement one that works for ALL Americans.  We've seen the 1st ever decline of average benchmark premiums on the federal health care exchange.  #DemDebate
Warren’s health care plan is a farce. She lies about how much it will cost &amp; who her tax increases will really hurt.  Worse yet, Warren's plan relies on cutting hospitals’ reimbursement rates—a change that would force a “substantial” number of hospitals to close.  #DemDebate
~1 MILLION jobs would be eliminated if 2020 Dems get their gov't takeover of health care—including medical assistants, billing clerks, &amp; other admin roles.  "Nearly 92% of these jobs are held by women, &amp; over a third are held by people of color," The Week reported.  #DemDebate
Under Bernie Sanders' gov't takeover of health care:    Taxes will go ⬆️ Quality of care will go ⬇️  His health care plan would financially crush hospitals, and many—especially rural health centers—would be forced to close "virtually overnight."  #DemDebate
Pete Buttigieg supports: ❌Rolling back tax cuts for middle-class families ❌Gov't-run health care ❌Higher corporate &amp; income taxes ❌A carbon tax that will raise energy prices ❌The costly Green New Deal ❌A parcel tax that will make owning a home more expensive  #DemDebate
It's the 9th Democrat Debate, but this is the 1st time we're meeting Michael Bloomberg.   Even so, he's right at home with the far-Left candidates. As mayor of NYC, he was banning things before Dems thought it was cool.   His plan for America: More government control.  #DemDebate

Like we heard during Friday’s Dem Debate, if 2020 Dems had their way, they would increase gov't control over nearly every aspect of American life.  In New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders’ gov't takeover of health care would kick 1.8 MILLION Granite Staters off their private insurance.
“We are saving your health care while the socialist Democrats are trying to take away your health care. We are making health care better &amp; much, much cheaper...We are protecting people w/ preexisting conditions, &amp; we always will—the Republican party always will.”—@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/BrtZDRBvgg
President Trump &amp; his Administration have taken substantial steps to combat the opioid crisis in New Hampshire—and across the country.  President Trump worked with Congress to pass the SUPPORT Act—the single largest legislative package to address a single drug crisis in HISTORY.

Democrats’ socialist agenda is wildly out of touch with New Hampshire.  Voters in the Granite State will remember that President Trump has kept his promises to: ☑️Create jobs ☑️Grow the economy ☑️Keep America safe

Thank you, @realDonaldTrump! https://t.co/OTDiy1Xabk
President Trump continues to deliver on his #PromisesMade to the people of Ohio.   Thanks to the #GOPTaxCuts, the average tax cut in OH was $1,476.   The historic tax legislation also created over 8,000 jobs in the state.   Ohio can't afford to turn back on this success!

President Trump is holding a #KeepAmericaGreat tonight in Toledo, Ohio!   Ohio is BOOMING under President Trump’s pro-growth agenda.   Nearly 100,000 jobs have been added to the Buckeye State since the President was elected—this includes over 13,000 manufacturing jobs.

Bernie Sanders’ bill, which Elizabeth Warren has co-sponsored, makes private health insurance illegal.    If enacted, Democrats would kick 176 million Americans off of their private health insurance plans, including over 18 MILLION Californians.
FACT CHECK: @realDonaldTrump is committed to ending surprise medical billing.  Under Pres. Trump, HHS is finalizing a rule that requires hospitals to show prices online.  Plus, we've seen the FIRST EVER decline of average benchmark premiums on the federal health care exchange. https://t.co/15wdcErETM
FACT CHECK: @realDonaldTrump is fixing our broken health care system.  President Trump has reduced the cost of health care and taken significant steps to fight the opioid epidemic. He has also made it clear that patients with preexisting conditions will be protected. https://t.co/fxTNJAa69w
Pres. Trump has enforced our nation’s immigration laws by closing dangerous loopholes &amp; taking aim at sanctuary cities.  He's called for common sense reforms to stop “Catch &amp; Release,” end chain migration, &amp; end the visa lottery program—so that immigrants come in based on merit.
Despite claiming her campaign is 100% grassroots funded, Warren has transferred $10.4M in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 run, a portion of which was raised from the same donor class she is now running against.
While President Trump just secured a phase one trade deal with China, Joe Biden’s record on China remains atrocious.   Back in May, Biden downplayed the Chinese threat to the American economy and doubled down in June stating, “What are we worried about?”
Joe Biden has proven to be disastrous on foreign policy.  Former DOD Secretary Bob Gates said that Biden “has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy &amp; national security issue over the past four decades.”  As VP, Biden consistently advocated for dangerous foreign policy.
Andrew Yang: He hasn't budged from his "free money" proposal—despite its impracticality.   Americans recognize that his core campaign plan to give $1,000 a month to every American after they turn 18 will exponentially raise taxes. https://t.co/J2FfbIHdTQ

FACT CHECK: @realDonaldTrump is creating American jobs.  Since President Trump was elected, 7.2 MILLION jobs have been added to our economy! https://t.co/exaIg3RTOM
FACT CHECK: @realDonaldTrump is putting more money in Americans' pockets.  Under President Trump, wage growth has remained at or above 3% for 16 months in a row—a benchmark reached for just 3 months TOTAL under President Obama. https://t.co/C9aO8985ma
Bernie Sanders: He has seen his prized government takeover of health care proposal become a "liability" to Democrats as support falls amid a split progressive voter base.  Voters are unnerved by his health care plan's sky-high price tag &amp; abolishment of private insurance. https://t.co/ayKb496utA
Impeachment is only about politics because the 7 Democrats on the stage tonight know they can’t beat Donald Trump at the ballot box.   That’s why they want to overthrow the will of the American people with the “thinnest record” for impeachment ever.
Dems never produced evidence of wrongdoing by Pres. Trump: —No support for their claim that POTUS withheld aid in exchange for an investigation —No proof that POTUS pressured Zelensky  House Dems who supported impeachment chose partisan politics over the will of Americans!
Joe Biden: Despite claiming to be a moderate candidate, Biden’s proposed tax hikes are DOUBLE what Hillary Clinton proposed in 2016.  Biden has yet to come clean about his son Hunter's corrupt business dealings with Ukraine while Joe served as Vice President. https://t.co/OB36SEc2wK

"Americans are not interested in this. Americans know that this President is working for them. We've got the results to prove it-- when you consider the economy, USMCA, military, jobs, the work he's doing on behalf of veterans. He is such a focused President." -@PressSec https://t.co/vWXdGDRqQb
If ANY doubt remained that the Dems’ partisan impeachment wasn’t solely about politics, look no further to what Rep. Jim Clyburn said when he admitted that impeachment “is all about” Trump’s 2016 campaign. https://t.co/s6Un3aGztv
House Democrats have held secret hearings in the House basement, selectively leaked information to further their own narrative, and suppressed the truth.   Democrats have pressed forward with their impeachment sham despite having ZERO evidence to substantiate their partisan goal.

Adam Schiff has acted like "king" of the hearings: —Interrupted questions from Republicans —Controlled all witnesses &amp; subpoenas —Refused to answer when asked if he would allow Republican witnesses  Schiff will stop at nothing to pursue his political vendetta against POTUS.
The House Intelligence Committee has proven to be deeply partisan.  Despite acting as impartial investigators, 11 out of 13 Dems on the Committee supported impeachment BEFORE holding an inquiry.  Three of them were so opposed to Pres. Trump in 2016 they skipped his inauguration.
Without Pres. Trump, the security assistance so many Dems are suddenly expressing concern over wouldn’t even exist.  POTUS changed American policy &amp; is giving the Ukrainians the lethal tools they need to counter Russian aggression.   Obama gave blankets, Trump gave Javelins.
The facts remain! The transcript of POTUS's call with Ukraine's President was released to the public.    There is NO EVIDENCE of quid pro quo!    Both President Zelensky and President Trump have said there was no pressure on the call.   #StopTheMadness! Text “MADNESS” to 80810.

President Trump is putting #AmericaFirst when it comes to trade.  He has proposed a modern trade deal to replace NAFTA—the "United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement."  When ratified the USCMA would spur economic growth, create 176K jobs, add $68.2B to the economy, &amp; raise wages.
Today, President @realDonaldTrump is speaking at the Economic Club of New York to discuss our thriving economy.    Since POTUS was elected, 6.9 MILLION jobs have been created AND the stock market has hit 108 record highs!

By a 5-point margin, more Americans want Joe Biden investigated than Pres. Trump.   The American people can see that Dems' impeachment sham is purely a political hit on Pres. Trump.    Biden has been dishonest about his family profiting off his position &amp; should be investigated.
Joe Biden's phony narrative about his son’s shady Ukraine business dealings came crashing down when the FOIA’d docs were revealed last week.   It's clear he's been dishonest w/ the American people about his family profiting off of his political position.  Time to come clean, Joe!

Here are just a FEW of the reasons Dems’ impeachment resolution is wrong, unfair, &amp; misleading.   Watch as @RepDLesko goes through the flaws of H. Res. 660, line by line. https://t.co/6juMHcuIOM
“The resolution merely seems to contemplate that…maybe someday in the future at some other phase of this, due process… might finally kick in— but only if the House Judiciary Committee feels like holding hearings and calling its own witnesses.” -@senatemajldr https://t.co/xD9S4l2jaG

While many Democrats and members of the media continue to try to politicize the pandemic, President Trump continues to lead and put the American people first.

From the outset, @realDonaldTrump vowed to devote the full resources of the federal government towards protecting the American people and helping our country weather the economic storm imposed by the coronavirus, and today he is once again doing just that.

RT @DonaldJTrumpJr: Good thread. https://t.co/iqk3azVPFa
BOTTOM LINE:  While @realDonaldTrump and his administration have been focused on protecting YOU, Democrats in Congress have been focused on attacking HIM! (8/8)
MAR 2:  The Trump administration secured commitments from top pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine to fight coronavirus.  Democrats began "quietly discussing moving ahead with punishments for individuals who defied subpoenas" in the impeachment sham. (7/8)
FEB 24:  @realDonaldTrump requested additional funding to fight the coronavirus.  Democrat Jerry Nadler demanded more documents from AG Barr to continue his political vendetta against the Trump administration. (6/8)
FEB 9:  The Trump administration’s Coronavirus Task Force met with governors to coordinate response efforts.  Chuck Schumer was busy soliciting inspectors general to open NEW investigations into @realDonaldTrump. (5/8)
JAN 31:  @realDonaldTrump initiated travel restrictions from China, which the experts have praised as a critical decision to slow the spread of coronavirus.  Democrat leaders called him “xenophobic” and “racist.” (4/8)
JAN 27: A tale of 2 press conferences.  @Mike_Pence outlined the administration's efforts to work with China to counter coronavirus.  Chuck Schumer demanded that more time be wasted with new impeachment witnesses. (3/8)
JAN 21:  The CDC activated its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support to confront coronavirus.  What were Congressional Democrats focused on?  Writing their opening arguments for their bogus impeachment trial. (2/8)
THREAD.  Since Democrats in Congress keep attacking @realDonaldTrump, let's compare records.  JAN 7:  CDC established a coronavirus incident management system, two days before China announced the outbreak.  Pelosi began Week 3 of withholding her sham impeachment articles. (1/8)
In ID, @realDonaldTrump nearly DOUBLED (110,453) his own vote total from 2016 (62,413).  In MS, with 98% Reporting, @realDonaldTrump (234,289) received over DOUBLE the votes President Obama (97,304) received in 2012.  Dems simply cannot replicate this enthusiasm!
With 100% Reporting in Missouri, @realDonaldTrump (299K) received over FOUR TIMES the number of votes President Obama (64K) received in 2012, and over DOUBLE the number of votes President Bush (117K) received in 2004.   The enthusiasm is with Trump!
Michigan helped put @realDonaldTrump over the top in 2016, and we are seeing record-breaking enthusiasm for him tonight, as well.  With just 57% Reporting, President Trump (436,557) has already blown past President Obama's vote total (348,488) from 2012!
Congratulations @realDonaldTrump on winning the MICHIGAN primary!  For years, I watched the Democrat Party fail my state.  @realDonaldTrump came here with a message that resonated.  He has delivered on his promises and will win it again in 2020!

Is the timing of Pelosi’s change of heart on #USMCA fooling anyone?  House Democrats have spent months blindly opposing it.  While we appreciate their support, it shouldn’t take impeachment backfiring for them to join @realDonaldTrump in putting #AmericaFirst!
First they promised ‘collusion.' There was none.  After ‘quid pro quo’ failed, focus groups told them to try ‘bribery.’ There was none.   Pelosi can invent any false charge she wants, but Americans know this is yet another partisan attempt to overthrow a duly-elected President.
House Democrats are using impeachment to further their political agenda.  They don’t have facts on their side.  They don’t have a legitimate case.  They just can’t get over @realDonaldTrump’s win in 2016, and are doing whatever they can to stop him from winning again in 2020.
Here’s what we learned from the IG report:  *FBI officials misled the FISA court  *there were 17 inaccuracies &amp; omissions in their applications  *the CIA viewed the Steele dossier as an “internet rumor”  Comey’s FBI engaged in a stunning abuse of power.
“The malfeasance and misfeasance detailed in the Inspector General’s report reflects a clear abuse of the FISA process.” - Attorney General Bill Barr
The mainstream media cannot dispute this fact:  Comey’s FBI repeatedly misled the FISA court and omitted key facts about the phony Steele Dossier, which launched the 2-year, $35M Russia investigation.  This should have never happened!

Another day in Schiff’s kangaroo court, and the facts remain:  1. Ukraine said there was no pressure.  2. They were never aware of any hold on aid.  3. The aid flowed without any conditions.  It couldn’t be clearer: There was #NoQuidProQuo!

None of these witnesses’ opinions change the key facts:  1. No Ukrainian said they felt pressured by @realDonaldTrump.  2. Biden wasn’t investigated.  3. Aid flowed to Ukraine.  Everyone can #ReadTheTranscript – there’s no basis for impeachment!
Regardless of how media/Dems spin this, Vindman’s primary concern was that Ukraine receive unfettered U.S. aid.  But @realDonaldTrump sets the policy, not an NSC official he’s never met.  Moreover Trump is the only POTUS to ever send lethal aid to Ukraine.  Not once, but 3 times!

From the beginning, Adam Schiff has conducted Pelosi's sham impeachment inquiry from behind closed doors.  Is Schiff worried that a public investigation would expose even more lies he's told about @realDonaldTrump?
Adam Schiff &amp; Joe Biden need to come clean about their ties to the Democrat "whistleblower."  Not only did the person work with Biden, two of Schiff’s staffers worked with the "whistleblower" too.  Schiff already lied about his contact.  Where’s the media outrage?

With help from Hunter Biden’s firm, The University of Delaware secured almost $25 million in federal earmarks from Joe Biden.  Hunter's firm received and $1.5 million for their work on behalf of the school.

In less than 3 hours, 2020 Democrats said they want to confiscate guns, destroy your health care plan, eliminate fossil fuels, and send your taxes through the roof.  They make Hillary Clinton look moderate!

Nearly 3 hours of radical policies, not 1 mention of our booming economy.  That's because their socialist agenda would kill millions of jobs, more than double your taxes and destroy your health care.  We can't let them reverse the progress @realDonaldTrump has made!
Saying "2020 Democrats embrace socialism" is not a punch line.  They want the government to take over every aspect of our lives from education to health care.  When the choice is freedom vs. socialism, we are going to win every time! https://t.co/xztdWRRgeg

The Democrat Party’s message to illegal immigrants is clear:  If you come here illegally, you can stay.  If you come here illegally, you won’t be punished.  If you come here illegally, you’ll get free health care.  It’s totally outside the mainstream!  #DemDebate
Calling half of America “racist” might get you votes in this radical Democrat primary, but it isn’t going to win you any new voters next November.  @realDonaldTrump has been delivering results for ALL Americans – and it’s why he’s going to be re-elected in 2020!

Why a ban on fracking is so wrong:  Gas prices would triple.  14.8M Americans jobs would be lost.  Iran, Venezuela &amp; Russia get richer, more globally influential.  And get this, carbon emissions would GO UP.  2020 Dems don't want smart policy – they just want government control!

Proving that nothing is impossible, Democrats moved even further to the left tonight.  Once again, the Democrat candidates boasted extreme, socialist policies and a government takeover of every aspect of our lives.
The fact of the matter is:  As Dems falsely call @realDonaldTrump a racist, they ignore his record of:  *criminal justice reform *lowest unemployment for Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans *higher wages *6M new jobs  FACTS refute the divisive Dem rhetoric. #DemDebate

The mainstream media is never going to share @realDonaldTrump’s successes: -wages are up -unemployment is down -paychecks are growing   That’s why we’ve built the largest ground game to make sure voters know.    We can’t let Dems win in 2020! https://t.co/k0IHhqKr4x

On tonight’s #DemDebate stage, Americans witnessed a doubling down on Democrats’ radical, socialist proposals.   From a government takeover of health care to decriminalizing illegal immigration, Democrat candidates put their out-of-touch priorities on full display.
While 2020 Democrats talk, @realDonaldTrump has delivered for African Americans:  *lowest unemployment rate – ever *criminal justice reform *more money to historically black colleges than any president  #DemDebate
After just one hour, Dems want to:  *Decriminalize illegal immigration *Eliminate all private plans *Raise taxes on the middle class  “Yada yada yada” is right!  #DemDebate
The message from 2020 Dems is clear:  If you come here illegally, you’ll get free health care, free college, and you won’t be punished.  They want open borders – @realDonaldTrump wants secure ones.  #DemDebate
Bernie &amp; Warren brag about their govt takeover of health care, but over 5.5 MILLION people in Michigan would be kicked off their private plans.  And taxes on EVERYONE would go through the roof.  We can’t afford it.  #DemDebate

Since @realDonaldTrump was elected:   - Michigan added 107,300 jobs - Michigan added 27,500 manufacturing jobs - Michigan's unemployment rate fell from 5.1% to 4.2%   President Trump will Keep Michigan Great in 2020!
Democrats have been in charge of Baltimore for decades.  Baltimore had highest crime rate of all major US cities in 2018 and the highest homicide rate in 2017.    @realDonaldTrump is right to call out incompetent Democrat leadership!
Democrat presidential candidates are in Michigan where they will try and sell their radical agenda of a government takeover of health care. Michiganders don’t want that.   According to a recent poll, the majority of Michiganders oppose the elimination of private health insurance.

While Democrats compete for TV ratings, let's remember the facts:  Mueller's report DID uncover failures to address Russia's cyberattacks – during the Obama/Biden administration!  Where’s the criticism of that?

Time and time again, Democrats have turned a blind eye to Ilhan Omar &amp; Rashida Tlaib.  Tlaib said “ICE is terrorizing our communities” + praised Hezbollah terrorists.   Omar downplayed 9/11 + asked a judge for “compassion” for an ISIS recruit.  Where's the condemnation of that?

First Kamala Harris was for eliminating private health plans, then she claimed to be against it.  Last night she proudly endorsed it, now she claims she’s against it.  Harris isn’t just a liberal – she’s a liar.
Millions of Americans struggle to pay their own health care bills.  Now Democrats want us to pay illegal immigrants’?   We can’t afford their extreme agenda!
Kamala Harris raised her hand in support of stripping millions of Americans off their private health insurance and then turned around and raised her hand in support of giving illegal immigrants FREE healthcare.   This is the Democrat party’s priorities in a nutshell.
Democrats are calling for a socialist takeover of our economy.

Tonight was no different.    Democrats want a socialist agenda that includes sky high taxes on the middle class while giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants.    @realDonaldTrump’s AMERICA FIRST policies are working for ALL Americans.
The Democrat Party's message:  If you come here illegally, you can stay.  If you come here illegally, you won’t be punished.  If you come here illegally, you’ll get free health care.  Why have borders at all?  Oh right, they don’t want them either.  We can't let them win in 2020!
Every single Democrat on stage endorsed taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants.   There’s no way the American people are going to support it. This is beyond extreme.
Don't believe the 2020 Democrat lies:  *82% of middle-class Americans received an avg. $1,260 tax cut *90% of Americans saw an increase in take-home pay *Largest wage growth in a decade in 2018 *Child tax credit doubled *3.3% wage growth in 2018, the best in a decade
Bernie Sanders boasted that middle class Americans are going to have to pay more in taxes if his socialist policies are enacted.   The contrast could not be clearer - @realDonaldTrump cut taxes for the middle class, and Democrats want to tax middle class Americans into oblivion.

If every 2020 Democrat is so outraged by @realDonaldTrump's efforts to end the border crisis, wait until they see this clip of President Obama from 2014.   They don’t care about solving this, they only care about scoring political points! https://t.co/wvg1T52Aqk
Its absolutely disgusting what happened to @EricTrump.   In a democracy, we should all be able to have disagreements without resorting to despicable acts like that.
The Dem harassment of @KellyannePolls is ridiculous.   Multiple Obama staffers routinely engaged in politics while in their official roles.   Obama’s press secretary criticized Trump over 35 times from the WH podium - and was never investigated.   Talk about a double standard.
By bringing Mueller in to testify, Democrats are admitting they just want a do-over.  The 2 year-long investigation totally vindicated @realDonaldTrump.  There was no collusion and no obstruction.  But Jerry Nadler and crew will do anything to continue their political vendetta.
Since @realDonaldTrump was elected, Hispanic Americans have seen:   *record-low unemployment *historically-low poverty rates *a President who is finally standing up to socialism &amp; communism in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba   #LatinosForTrump

The contrast could not be more stark.   While Obama/Biden abandoned a missile-defense system in Poland on the 70th anniversary of the USSR’s invasion of the country in WWII, @realDonaldTrump has gotten tough on Russia and is reaffirming our commitment to our Polish allies.

There’s a border crisis &amp; a historic trade deal waiting for Congressional approval.  But what are Dems focused on today?  ANOTHER hearing on Russia with testimony from a relic of the 1970s.  It’s obvious: Dems would rather relitigate 2016 than accomplish anything for the country.
Obama &amp; Biden failed to act while Russia was engaged in a cyber attack against America.  Their response? Susan Rice told the national security team to “stand down.”  Why don’t Democrats like Adam Schiff ever criticize that?
The border crisis in context:  “We had 2 prior surges of families &amp; children at the border: 2014 &amp; 2016. At that time President Obama called it a 'humanitarian crisis.'

The #USMCA would:    *cut red tape at the border *reduce costs for border transactions *eliminate unnecessary regulations  Why won't Pelosi bring it to the floor?  Because @realDonaldTrump negotiated it.  Tell Pelosi to drop the obstruction &amp; support American businesses!
Let’s be clear: The crisis at the southern border is a national security threat.   Democrats’ continued obstruction of @realDonaldTrump is putting Americans at risk. https://t.co/xyQqkQur7w

Unemployment for workers without a bachelor’s degree is now a *record low*   From creating 6 MILLION jobs to hitting record lows for African Americans, Hispanics &amp; Asians, @realDonaldTrump is fighting for workers left behind by Obama and Biden!
Jerry Nadler has made a mockery of the House Judiciary Committee.  He lied for two years about @realDonaldTrump and collusion.  His shameless political tactics have gone too far.
After weeks of confusion on where he stands, Joe Biden just endorsed unlimited taxpayer funding of abortion.  Biden should've just plagiarized his position from Planned Parenthood’s website from the start like he's been doing for his other policy positions.

It doesn’t matter who Democrats nominate in 2020.  Every single Democrat running is openly embracing radical socialist policies at a time when our economy is booming.  @realDonaldTrump is right: “America will NEVER be a socialist country!”
In May, Customs and Border Protection arrested 144,278 illegal immigrants.  That’s a 623 PERCENT increase from just two years ago.  @realDonaldTrump is right: We must finish the wall and secure the border!

Joe Biden has officially embraced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s socialist agenda.  The “Green New Deal” they support would mean tax rates of 100% on nearly every family and would pay people “unwilling to work.”  Biden is no moderate – he’s just as extreme as the rest of them!

Pete Buttigieg puts a mild-mannered face on extreme polices like court-packing, late-term abortion, the socialist Green New Deal &amp; government-run health care.  Don’t be fooled: He’s as liberal as the rest of the Democrats running.

If it’s Sunday, it means Adam Schiff spreading more lies on TV.  Despite Democrats promising evidence of collusion, @realDonaldTrump was totally cleared.  The American people want the collusion delusion to end.
For years, the Mexican government has failed to take the necessary steps to curb illegal immigration.  .@realDonaldTrump is taking action.  Democrats need do so as well.

The Democrats are consumed with impeachment and obstruction.   What accomplishments do they have to run on?   Zero.   @realDonaldTrump has higher wages, 6M jobs, a stronger military, good judges – and that's going to be great for him in 2020! https://t.co/ej8vBbuBVO

The mainstream media barely mentions it, but Obama and Biden totally dropped the ball on Russia.  For two years they knew Russia was planning a cyberattack.  For two years they turned a blind eye.  Where’s the Democrat outrage about that?
You're right, Justin. Instead of grandstanding, there's a LOT of work Congress (you) can do.  You can start with: *ratifying #USMCA *funding border security *merit-based immigration reform *an infrastructure bill *passing legislation to lower drug prices https://t.co/Kpvs9n6hJZ
After 675 days, $35 million, 500 search warrants and 2,800 subpoenas, the Mueller report debunked Democrats’ lies about @realDonaldTrump-Russia collusion.  Democrats will try their best to drag this out, but the American people – and Mueller himself – want them to move on.
Despite Joe Biden’s best attempts to hide from the campaign trail, he can’t hide from is his record.  Biden supported NAFTA which hurt American workers, he "supercharged” the opioid crisis, and made a career of disastrous foreign policy decisions. https://t.co/sGWLQmdNG5

Since Election Day, 36,000 jobs have been added in Wisconsin and with the passage of the #USMCA, more than 50,000 manufacturing jobs would be created all across the country, giving America’s workers the tools they need to succeed! #USMCAnow https://t.co/AdRTgJXVtY

I’ll make you a promise. Whatever Democrats in Congress want to do to obstruct our agenda or roll out their latest accusations to divide our country, President @realDonaldTrump &amp; I will never stop fighting for the policies &amp; ideals that have made this country Great Again! 🇺🇸
Last week, Democrats were trying to impeach Justice Brett Kavanaugh on discredited allegations. This week, they began an impeachment inquiry before they even had the facts. The American people deserve better.
That’s why it’s such a shame what Democrats are doing in Congress. For the last 2 1/2 years Democrats spread baseless accusations of Russian collusion... then the Justice Department found NO collusion and NO obstruction.

The NeuroDiagnostic Institute is the first Indiana psychiatric hospital built in 50 years &amp; is a model for the Nation on addressing drug abuse, mental health &amp; public safety.

...They can’t run against this President’s record...a record of accomplishment...so they decided to look for one more way to try to overturn the election and it’s not going to work. The American people see through it!” - VP Pence on @LouDobbs
“63 million Americans voted for President @realDonaldTrump and put this administration in the @WhiteHouse and, from the day after the election, the Democrats have been trying to overturn the results of that election...
But different from the last Administration, under President @realDonaldTrump, we’ve actually been providing defensive weapons. The Obama Administration was sending them blankets and pillows.” – VP Pence on @LouDobbs

Today, President @realDonaldTrump announced additional steps that the United States will take to protect religious liberty and defend people of faith around the world. https://t.co/IjnXbDMaXn
Earlier this year, at the President's direction, @SecPompeo held the second annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, inviting more than a thousand civil society and religious leaders, from 100 different nations, to the largest event of its kind in the world.
The United States created the Genocide Recovery and Persecution Response Program, and we’ve provided over $370 million in aid to ethnic minority and faith communities persecuted by ISIS in Iraq and throughout that region.
The threats to religious freedom and attacks on people of faith underscore why President @realDonaldTrump has taken such decisive action to build and promote our nation’s proud tradition of advancing religious freedom.
Today, President Trump became the first President to convene a meeting on religious freedom at the UN. There’s no better time for a meeting like this one on the world stage as more than 80% of the world’s population live in nations where religious freedom is threatened or banned. https://t.co/lL1nUCqA2l

ignoring the excellent care being provided to families and children. Our great @CBP agents deserve better and the American people deserve the whole story from CNN! https://t.co/hsKsU6umhW
Rather than broadcast the full story, showing the compassionate care the American people are providing to vulnerable families, tonight CNN only played video of men in the temporary facility and didn’t play any footage of the family facility at all...
These men were in a temporary holding area because Democrats in Congress have refused to fund additional bed space.
The crisis at our southern border is not a “manufactured crisis”, it is real and is overwhelming our system. To show this, we also visited an overcrowded facility for adult men, many of whom have been arrested multiple times.
CNN is so dishonest. Today we took reporters to a detention facility on the border for families and children and all told us they were being treated well.
Thank you to the brave men and women of @CBP working tirelessly each day to secure our border. The work you do not only keeps our country safe but keeps the American people safe and we are so grateful for your service! https://t.co/aK4St41YFd

Proud to be part of an Administration that protects the sanctity of life. From the Mexico City policy, to nominating pro life judges, to ending taxpayer funding of fetal tissue research, the Trump Administration will fight for the most innocent and vulnerable among us.
We are committed to fighting the opioid epidemic sweeping our nation. This crisis has been declared a Nationwide Public Health Emergency and the Trump Administration will continue to support those suffering from the grip of addiction.
The African American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment rates have all reached record lows under President @realDonaldTrump’s decisive leadership!
Nearly 6 MILLION jobs have been created since President @realDonaldTrump took office and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6% – its lowest point in 50 years! America is thriving under the Trump economy!
Over the last two and half years, President @realDonaldTrump has fought tirelessly for the safety and security of our country. We will continue to work to protect our land so that all Americans may prosper!

The Venzuelan people are suffering under the brutal and oppressive dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. The political crisis in Venezuela has caused more than 4 million Venezuelans to leave their country and it is only getting worse.   This must end NOW. #VenezuelaLibre
Under President @realDonaldTrump, the United States has provided more than $213 million in humanitarian assistance to suffering Venezuelans as a result of a brutal dictatorship. We stand with @jguaido and the people of Venezuela! #VenezuelaLibre

In early 2017, a top economic adviser for the Obama administration, said we would never get to 3% economic growth. He said you would have to believe in the tooth fairy for that. No — you had to believe in @POTUS Trump's agenda for this economy! https://t.co/sMmhLDJBax
263,000 jobs in April &amp; the LOWEST unemployment in nearly 50 years! 1st quarter economic growth of 3.2% after 8 years under Obama &amp; Biden where we regularly saw less than 2% economic growth. This is a great day for America and it is all a result of the leadership of @POTUS Trump! https://t.co/4zR6FxbBol

The truth is, @POTUS &amp; our Administration have done our jobs and negotiated a deal that puts American jobs and American workers FIRST. Now it’s time for Congress to do their job – and pass the USMCA. https://t.co/mJphr21zGJ
The USMCA will impact more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs that depend on exports to Canada &amp; Mexico. It’s vital because the USMCA will finally give workers the level playing field that we need to compete &amp; WIN on a global stage. https://t.co/AdBxxK5L2Q
Automakers, their suppliers, their dealerships, and the local businesses that support them employ more than 7.25 million Americans every year – more than any other manufacturing sector in our country. And the USMCA is a WIN for the auto industry! https://t.co/HJeyOAqux1
We have a @POTUS who understands that when a nation BUILDS, it GROWS, and the auto industry is the backbone of American manufacturing! https://t.co/4YfbYcKCz4
The last administration saw America lose 210K manufacturing jobs &amp; said you’d need to ”wave a magic wand” to get them back.

A word to this rising generation: Those of you who feel drawn to the siren song of socialism, be careful what you wish for. Socialism is not the road to freedom. Socialism is the road to government control. And it grows in the soil of censorship. https://t.co/WZ7uNNMbIg
The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, and freedom has the momentum. Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolas Maduro must go! https://t.co/GaLwgUa6T6
As @POTUS has said: On Venezuela, all options are on the table. Nicolas Maduro would do well not to test the resolve of the United States of America. Maduro must go!
.@POTUS is taking action against a vital source of the Maduro regime’s wealth. Today the U.S. will sanction 34 vessels owned or operated by PDVSA, as well as 2 additional companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba. Venezuela’s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people!

On the eve of the 70th Anniversary of @NATO, I’m reminded of what @POTUS said in Poland two years ago: “The West will never ever be broken.  Our values will prevail.  Our people will thrive.  And our civilization will triumph.” https://t.co/fPfPZB1YYj
China’s expanding influence will necessarily demand more of America’s attention and resources. As we meet that challenge, our European allies must do more to maintain the strength and deterrence of the @NATO Alliance.
Turkey must choose. Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our @NATO alliance?
.@POTUS has made it clear that we will not stand idly by while @NATO allies purchase weapons from our adversaries that threaten the cohesion of our alliance.
.@NATO is a mutual defense pact, not a unilateral security guarantee. We need all Allies to contribute to this joint endeavor and honor their commitments.
We’ve been making historic investments in our national defense and @NATO. America is leading on the world stage once again and part of leadership is being as good as your word and holding your friends and allies to theirs.
In the 70 yrs since, the US has kept our commitments – &amp; we’ve urged our European allies to do the same. And as @POTUS said yesterday when he met with @jensstoltenberg, in the last 2 years, “Tremendous progress has been made – &amp; @NATO is much stronger because of that progress.”
Tomorrow marks 70 years since the United States and 11 of our allies signed the North Atlantic Treaty &amp; committed ourselves to “safeguard the freedom, common heritage &amp; civilisation of [our] peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.

This week, @POTUS has taken decisive action to repeal and replace ObamaCare – we will never give up, we will never relent, in our effort to put American healthcare back on the path to more choices, more affordability, and more freedom!
As ObamaCare fails, Democrats are continuing their quest for a government takeover of health care – under the guise of “Medicare-for-All.” Socialized medicine will lead our country to rationed healthcare – &amp; to bureaucrats making the most important decisions effecting our lives.
ObamaCare restricted freedom &amp; reduced choices. ObamaCare has failed. Costs have skyrocketed – premiums on the individual market rose by 105%. Choices have plummeted, as insurance companies have pulled out of the market.

As @POTUS will discuss today with law enforcement: in 2017, 192 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. One Senator said to me, “We don’t just have a crisis on our southern border. We have a crisis of drug addiction in all 50 states.” https://t.co/NvblGTdJCO

Despite @POTUS’ clear, legal authority, some in Congress are trying to stop him from exercising the authority THEY gave him to address the crisis. A vote against the emergency declaration is a vote against border security, a vote to deny the real crisis on our Southern Border. https://t.co/jDIU21m8iY

Today, President Bush becomes the 32nd American to lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda. Soon, Americans from every corner of the country and every walk of life will make their way to this Rotunda to pay the respects of a grateful Nation. #CAVU #Remembering41
When President George HW Bush left office, he left America &amp; the world more peaceful, prosperous &amp; secure. He was a great leader who made a great difference in the life of this Nation. But he also was a good man who was devoted to his wife, his family &amp; his friends. https://t.co/6xAiPR4as3
While he was known as the quiet man, it was not for lack of nerve or daring. For in all of his 94 years, President Bush never lost his love of adventure and never failed to answer the call to serve his country. #CAVU #Remembering41 https://t.co/JpMqUF61Dx

We send our prayers &amp; deepest condolences to the entire Bush family. We join them &amp; the American people in mourning the passing of this good &amp; great man. His example will always inspire and his lifetime of service will be enshrined in the hearts of the American people forever.
Beginning w/ his service in WWII, George HW Bush always answered the call to serve. His years in Congress, as a diplomat, CIA Dir &amp; Vice President were characterized by modesty, integrity &amp; patriotism. His years as POTUS left the US &amp; the world more peaceful, prosperous &amp; secure.
Karen and I were saddened to learn of the passing of President George H.W. Bush and we send our deepest sympathies to the entire Bush family. President Bush loved his family, loved this country and his legacy will be a lifetime of service to the United States of America.

Republicans unleashed the world's hottest economy by cutting taxes—not raising them.  But Dems don't even try to hide it anymore.

The media called al-Baghdadi an austere religious scholar &amp; Soleimani a revered leader.  Then just when you think they can’t sink any lower...

With an economy this good, it's no wonder Barack Obama is trying to take credit.  But I believe the saying is: "You didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”  @realDonaldTrump made that happen. https://t.co/8jsgdxrvZj
Dems don’t want you to know being denied care is the reality of the government-run healthcare they want.  Bloomberg was the first to slip &amp; admit it:  If you're 95 years old &amp; have cancer, "we should say go &amp; enjoy…there's no cure &amp; we can't do anything." https://t.co/VXJNH3XetK

I call on Speaker Pelosi to halt all House Floor action on her impeachment sham until we pass a realistic plan to lower prescription drug costs for seniors &amp; families.  Americans want a bipartisan solution to this serious problem, not another messaging bill from progressives.
Today was a disaster for every American struggling to afford their prescription medicine.  Given the choice between a partisan drug scheme that can never become law &amp; a bipartisan bill that could be on @realDonaldTrump's desk this week, radical Dems chose Pelosi’s partisan plan.
Dems know impeachment is backfiring. They thought "made-for-TV" stunts would convince Americans—but looks like they didn't even convince their own Members.  Now they're trying to walk it back.  But Republicans are united! I'm proud to whip ALL our Members to vote NO on this sham. https://t.co/vX2bVUgHc1

It’s long past time for Speaker Pelosi to stand up to the most radical elements of her conference, and condemn the anti-Semitic vitriol espoused by Reps. Omar and Tlaib, and others in their party, that threaten to undermine our strongest ally in the Middle East.
Just like we expect people to respect our laws, Israeli law allows the government to block the entry of those who advocate for these destructive BDS policies, and we should respect their laws as well.
By attempting to travel to Israel with an organization that includes members who support terrorism against Israel, Reps. Omar &amp; Tlaib made it clear the only intention of their visit was to spew hate &amp; advocate for policies that would actively undermine the Jewish state of Israel.
Reps. Omar and Tlaib have consistently refused to recognize the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, and actively support its demise by supporting the anti-Semitic BDS movement that calls for a worldwide boycott of Israel’s economy.

These events are tragedies. Reducing them to talking points and name-calling in support of narrow political agendas only further divides our country.   Jennifer and I pray for the people of El Paso and Dayton. May God help us and heal this great nation.
In a media culture that encourages viewing people solely through hyper-partisan lenses, and not as neighbors and fellow citizens, dangerous division and hatred of those you disagree with is the outcome. This can often lead to violent consequences, as I've personally experienced.
There is clearly a culture of death in America today. Violence is glorified and normalized on our screens every day. Instead of seeking professional help for mental health problems, men are being radicalized in online forums. This must stop.
These events should be classified as domestic terrorism, and I’m glad that in the case of El Paso, the FBI is treating it as such. We must better equip our law enforcement agencies to prevent these massacres before they happen.
THREAD:  There is a sickness in our nation. Our religious &amp; community institutions—the glue that bonds us—are declining as a central force in society, while the politicization of every aspect of life rises. These shooters turned to hatred &amp; violence—as a result, dozens are dead.

Tonight’s deal also puts us in a better position to make USMCA a reality, which would produce real wins for American workers and businesses. I urge Pelosi to swiftly bring it to the floor so we can grow an even stronger American economy while also making our border more secure.
President Trump’s newly-signed agreement with Mexico is great news for both our economy and our country’s border security. Once again, @realDonaldTrump has proven those who doubted him wrong by getting Mexico to step up their efforts to help us secure our southern border.

Across America, even more &amp; more DEMOCRATS (up 17% since January) are concerned about the illegal immigration crisis, but House Dems refuse to acknowledge it. They need to listen to the American people: We need a wall to stop the flow of deadly drugs &amp; criminals into our country. https://t.co/a2QB6mkrv8
Instead of dangerous proposals like the #GreenNewDeal that would outsource energy production &amp; manufacturing to nations that lack environmental safeguards, we should focus on using all forms of U.S. energy sources to cut costs for families &amp; create jobs. https://t.co/NE4yprl6qp

Illegal immigrants won’t stop pouring into America until we fully enforce our immigration laws. Right now, they know they’ll be set free after turning themselves in to CBP agents.

Democrats can't keep denying there's a crisis at our border → Cartels are charging adults &amp; children up to $9,000/person to be smuggled into America, and they're using the profits to fund dangerous drug &amp; human trafficking operations.

Why do Democrats always seem to prioritize criminals over law abiding citizens? Now they want to give voting rights to violent criminals in prison and terrorists like the Boston Marathon bomber as they take away our 2nd Amendment right to defend ourselves. Not on our watch! https://t.co/USzcCy0ODu
Thank you @NRA for inviting me to speak at your annual conference this year! My experience with gun violence further underscored my beliefs → we need a strong 2nd Amendment so we can defend ourselves and our families from criminals and others who want to do us harm. https://t.co/EKNPnzXgI1

The #GreenNewDeal would leave us with nothing but massive unemployment, high electricity costs, &amp; weakened national security. Instead of this radical disaster, we should be pursuing an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes reliable sources like oil in addition to renewables.

With wide bipartisan support the House has agreed: the American people deserve to know the truth about what, if anything, special counsel Mueller has uncovered, and now we should finally see this investigation come to a close.
Since the investigation began, Democrats have used it as an excuse to fundraise, fear-monger, and peddle conspiracy theories about collusion with the Russian government. Let’s bring this chapter to a close.
After taking nearly two years, costing tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, and providing limited public information about its scope, I am especially concerned about what would happen if the report was not made available to Congress.
Like millions of other Americans, I feel it's long overdue for special counsel Mueller to wrap up his meandering probe and show the American people, in a transparent way, what his findings were, and also, how many tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were spent to carry this out.

Republicans weren't consulted on H.R. 1, and Democrats once again voted down every single Republican amendment to the bill. It sets up a system of fraud, abuse, and misuse of taxpayer funds. Bottom line: H.R. 1 leaves the future and integrity of our elections in doubt.
Follow the money: H.R. 1 diverts taxpayer funds into candidates' and consultants' pockets by expanding the use of campaign funds to include child care and other personal expenses. Democrats are pursuing "reforms" that benefit themselves, not the American people.
After promising to run a transparent House, Democrats let special interest groups write a 622-page federal takeover of elections blatantly tailored to use taxpayer money to enrich candidates and campaign consultants with a 6 to 1 taxpayer-funded match of small dollar donations.

A new low for Democrats → By voting to make it harder for domestic violence victims to protect themselves from abusers, Democrats proved to the American people that they aren’t serious about preventing gun violence and are instead just interested in pushing their liberal agenda. https://t.co/g2Tg9GyGao
Every day in this country guns are used by good people to defend themselves against bad people and H.R. 8 is going to make it harder for them to get access to these guns. This is a bad gun control bill that does nothing but criminalize law-abiding citizens.
Democrats say there is an exemption for hunting in the bill, but it’s written so vaguely that if you want to loan your gun to a hunting buddy, you might need to bring along your attorney to find out if loaning a shotgun to your friend makes you a criminal.
Under this bill, a woman might have to wait 20 business days to get a gun to protect herself from domestic violence if the NICS system isn’t working. If she borrows a firearm for self-defense, the friend who loans her a gun would face a year in prison and up to a $100,000 fine.
I strongly oppose the gun control bills brought forward this week under the guise of background checks. Republicans identified many problems with this bill and the Democrat majority shut out almost every one of our solutions.

Democrats refused to listen to my testimony as a survivor of gun violence and supporter of the 2nd Amendment because they're only interested in hearing from liberal gun control advocates. But Americans deserve the truth about their gun control bill, so I won't stop speaking out. https://t.co/YDFxYbJVTy

Soon, every Democrat will have to go on record and tell the American people if they stand with most Americans who are against unchecked abortions, or if they stand with their radical base. https://t.co/YWDJ9Nvm25
It’s no coincidence that more Americans have identified as pro-life over the past month as Democrats advocated for radical infanticide practices. This month, I started the process to force consideration on the House Floor of a bill to protect babies born alive during an abortion. https://t.co/48w316MEyd
I will never stop fighting for the unborn. I recently joined with @RepAnnWagner to begin forcing a vote on the House Floor to protect babies born alive during abortions. Working closely with @realDonaldTrump, we're taking bold steps toward protecting innocent life at all stages.

Fortunately, @realDonaldTrump made a promise to the American people to build wall in areas where drugs, human trafficking, and criminals flow freely into the U.S., and this deal ensures he has the flexibility and access to funds to build more wall and secure America’s border.
It’s a shame that Speaker Pelosi continues to ignore the recommendations of the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect our border, and refuses to support the full $5.7 billion requested for physical barriers.
I applaud @realDonaldTrump’s decision to sign this funding bill, as well as the steps he's taking to keep America safe. $1.375 billion in funding for 55 miles of badly-needed border wall is a big step, but clearly falls short of what Republicans wanted and what @POTUS requested.

During the next three weeks of this short-term agreement, Pelosi and Schumer need to stop playing partisan games and finally take serious steps to address the humanitarian and safety risks at the southern border while also reaching a long-term agreement on government funding.
One thing is clear from this last 35 days: Pelosi and Schumer would rather force the longest government shutdown in our history than fund border security that is critical to the safety of our nation.
Yet each time, Pelosi and Schumer refused to come to the table or even present a counteroffer. Now, once again, President Trump is exhibiting leadership by agreeing to re-open even though we still haven’t reached an agreement on border security.
Time and time again, President Trump proposed reasonable solutions that would open the government and secure our borders, while also including policies that Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have previously supported.
Over the last month, Speaker Pelosi and liberals in Washington have put their personal differences with President Trump over the security of our border and the paychecks of federal workers.

Democrats claim to want open negotiations—but after a group of them went to meet with @realDonaldTrump, their own leadership said they weren't authorized to make a deal.

The reality: Democrats won't put up a dime for a wall that stops criminals &amp; drugs from pouring over our border—but instead passed a bill that sets aside taxpayer money for foreign organizations that provide abortions.

It’s time for this shutdown to end. If Democrats don’t support funding the resources our experts say they need to secure our border, they need to provide their own counteroffer of what they’d suggest instead. They claim to support border security, but they won't vote for it. https://t.co/aJRHiKyBRt
RT @HouseGOP: Democrats of 2019, meet Democrats of 2014. You two have a lot to talk about... https://t.co/0xoO5Ux5uB
Democrats failed their 1st test at governing: by refusing to meet with @POTUS to reopen govt &amp; secure our border, they’re turning over their voting cards to Pelosi &amp; denying their constituents a voice in these negotiations. You can’t serve the American people if you don’t show up
You can’t say you’re for border security if you’re not going to fund the tools it takes to actually secure our border. A $1 offer for the wall is an insult to the employees going without a paycheck &amp; to the communities impacted by the criminals &amp; drugs pouring across our border. https://t.co/tbudA2jpkz
What’s it going to take to end this shutdown? Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer finally coming to the table with a real counteroffer to effectively secure our southern border and stop convicted criminals, heroin, and human traffickers from pouring into our communities. https://t.co/qoiWoip1h3

Allowing the status quo at the border to continue is immoral. Democrats need to put security first. - 17,000 criminals caught last year at the border - 90% of heroin in the US comes across the southern border - ICE saved 900 kids last year from human trafficking &amp; sexual assault
No, a wall is not immoral. What’s immoral is Democrats ignoring the dangers of their open borders agenda. What’s immoral is Democrats jetting off to Puerto Rico instead of staying in DC to negotiate with @realDonaldTrump to end the shutdown. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/7VFGIdHiUa

Bottom line: We need a wall at our border to stop criminals, drugs, &amp; human traffickers from pouring into our country. This isn’t new: Democrats have acknowledged this in the past. It’s time they put their hatred of @realDonaldTrump aside &amp; put the people of this country first. https://t.co/IbkAaoS2Qb
It’s been weeks and Democrats haven’t made a single counteroffer to secure our border. How much more crime at our border and in our communities do they need to see before they start taking this seriously and stop holding our government and our safety hostage? https://t.co/hGuRkH2Bil

Democrats love to complain to the media about the government being closed, but for the 2 weeks they’ve had the majority, they’ve voted to leave for the weekend—over the objection of Republicans—instead of staying to work with us and @realDonaldTrump on a solution. Talk is cheap. https://t.co/sOkInfEkgA
We could have the government open today if Democrats were willing to even try to propose a serious offer that addresses wall funding. But instead, Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn’t offer more than $1 for the wall. That’s how unserious Democrats are about reopening the government. https://t.co/PODePY7HYw

From DHS: There are nearly 2,100 illegal entries a day at our southern border. Last year alone, 17,000 criminals were apprehended at the border, and DHS prevented 3,755 known or suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United States.

Democrats continue to choose open borders over open government and safe communities. I’ll be on @foxandfriends soon to discuss. Tune in!
Democrats are playing a dangerous game with the safety of our communities, and the brave ICE and CBP agents who are at risk at the border protecting us. They need to stop putting their political opposition to Trump over America’s security. Pass the bill. Enough is enough.
This is why we need the wall: Nearly 17,000 criminals were apprehended at the border last year, many smuggling deadly drugs. ICE saved over 900 children from human trafficking last year.
Our border is in crisis. Here are the facts: Over the past 2 months, border patrol saw a nearly 90% increase in the # of attempted illegal crossings compared to the same time last year—a 44% increase in unaccompanied minors alone. There are almost 2,000 inadmissible entries a day
Here’s the reality: Walls work. Illegal traffic has dropped over 95% in Yuma over 9 years since a wall was built there in 2005, over 90% over 15 years in Tucson where a wall exists, and over 92% in the area of San Diego with a wall over the last 23 years.
Democrats are so committed to their open borders agenda that they shut the government down days before Christmas rather than protect our border from crime, human trafficking, and drugs.
Americans want safe communities and secure borders. They see right through the dangerous political game Democrats are playing. https://t.co/Hg5yGKFAgb

While Democrats may have won the House by running a fear-mongering campaign, unfortunately their reckless legislating has not proven to be as effective for the American people who have to live under this failed system.
Not only does tonight's ruling confirm that this broken law cannot hold up under court scrutiny, but it also affirms that the law does not actually protect people with preexisting conditions.
Over the last 8 years since it was signed into law, we have found out that the Democrats who passed it caused millions of families to lose the plans and doctors they liked, and imposed unaffordable premiums and deductibles that undermine the basic coverage that families enjoy.
When Democrats forced Obamacare down the throats of the American people on a purely partisan basis, they threatened that the law needed to be passed so that people could find out what was in it.

I find it disingenuous when some in the media refuse to report or call out actual violence by leftist protestors, yet they’ll whip into a hysterical frenzy over what clearly was a joke at a rally. This is about which party has the best ideas, not which party has the most bullies.
It’s irresponsible for the mainstream media to create a false equivalence between this and Democrat leaders in Washington regularly using threatening rhetoric to call on their supporters to harass Trump officials, supporters, and Republican members and candidates.
President Trump was clearly ribbing Congressman Gianforte for last year’s incident, which he apologized for last year. It’s obvious he was not encouraging his supporters to engage in attacks, and not one person harassed the numerous media reporters who were present.

Bottom line: America's law enforcement agents keep our communities safe. They deserve our support and thanks, not threats against their lives. Republicans #StandWithICE. Meanwhile, 167 House Democrats refused to vote 'YES' on a resolution supporting #ICE.
Last year alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents saved 900+ kids from sexual exploitation, rescued 500+ victims from human trafficking, arrested 127,000 aliens with criminal convictions or charges, and seized more than 980,000 pounds of narcotics.

While Democrats visit New Orleans to tout their radical, out-of-touch agenda, we'll keep working with @realDonaldTrump to address issues that actually affect American workers and families by implementing policies to grow the economy, create jobs, and strengthen national security.
Last year, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement agents saved 900+ kids from sexual assault or human trafficking. While Republicans voted in favor of a resolution supporting ICE &amp; the work they do to protect America, the majority of Democrats voted "present" &amp; 34 voted against it.
The economy isn't the only place Republicans and Democrats differ. When it comes to enforcing the law, some on the Left would rather not. Sen Harris thinks it's outrageous that a criminal who is here illegally would be deported, and many Democrats want to abolish ICE entirely.
A Louisiana restaurant owner told me the #TaxCuts have led to more people eating out at her restaurant. Another family used the extra money to make home repairs. People are seeing real results. Democrats want to raise taxes on your family. We want to make your tax cuts permanent.
While Senator Booker was calling the Republican policies that created jobs &amp; gains for workers "reckless, unjust, and just plain cruel," Americans everywhere were getting to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks and seeing new opportunities to achieve the American Dream.
As Democratic leaders descend on New Orleans for the leftist Netroots Nation conference, the contrast between our focus on creating jobs &amp; keeping communities safe, &amp; their radical message of big-government socialism &amp; open borders could not be starker.  https://t.co/hdmGJN0oaN

We appreciate the relationship between the Zurich Insurance Group, the PGA Tour, and the City of New Orleans. This is great news for New Orleans, and I look forward to the continued economic boost the Zurich Classic will bring to our region for many years to come.
Not only is our city known for it's world-class food, music, and culture, but we also have some of the best golf courses in the country, which makes us the perfect choice for the PGA Tour.
Today I met with Zurich North America CEO Kathleen Savio, as well as the rest of her leadership team, and was thrilled to hear that the company will extend their contract with the PGA Tour to keep the Zurich Classic in New Orleans for another seven years. https://t.co/eLlHNJQzF9

Since the 2016 election, Democrats have pushed their political agenda and ignored the will of the American people. I am glad to see our President acquitted, signaling an end to this political charade so we can finally return our focus to the pressing issues facing our country.
Without acknowledging that environmental protection and economic development can occur simultaneously, those who advocate for a withdrawal have entirely ignored the will of the people of Northern Minnesota. Great to see my colleague @RepPeteStauber continue to give them a voice.

Mining has been a way of life for Minnesotans, and it plays a huge role in the future success of our state, and our country as a whole. Mining opponents behind illegal withdrawal have been proposing their most aggressive undermining of environmental standards to date!

Here with my friend @RepPeteStauber. The withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of acres proposed by #HR5598 tells Northern Minnesotans they can’t be trusted to be good stewards of their land, and mine safely and responsibly.

Wishing you all a happy Thanksgiving with those you love the most! As Americans and Minnesotans - we have so much to be grateful for. Happy Thanksgiving to all!
@CDCgov @sctimes @POTUS @UMNExt Due to our farmer's hard work, the cost of a Thanksgiving meal is less than $5 per person according to the @FarmBureau &amp; turkeys, which Minnesota is the largest producer of, are 4% cheaper than last year! For the world’s most affordable food supply, don’t forget to #ThankAFarmer!
@CDCgov @sctimes @POTUS Recently, my colleagues in the House and Senate showed Americans living in farm country that they have our full support by providing funding for FRSAN. An initial 450,000 was granted to @UMNExt and Iowa Extension to begin a pilot program. https://t.co/TsFTd0Gp3x
@CDCgov @sctimes The Farm Bill passed the House and was ultimately signed by @POTUS, with my STRESS Act included. I was proud to see this effort move forward with support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. https://t.co/CU0CuGg1cp
@CDCgov Read more background on the intention behind the STRESS Act via the @sctimes here ↓ https://t.co/5XL4bhEwyl
@CDCgov The Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) will give states needed resources to provide services including hotlines, community outreach, education, &amp; home delivery of assistance. I was successful in including this language in the 2018 Farm Bill. https://t.co/0ePPC3liOK
@CDCgov As a result, I introduced the Stemming the Tide of Rural Economic Stress and Suicide (STRESS) Act to make mental health treatment available for farmers, ranchers, &amp; agricultural workers by reauthorizing the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN). https://t.co/lvGNTzYo6Q
@CDCgov Livelihoods of those who feed, fuel &amp; clothe the world depend on factors largely outside of their control, which can be a uniquely stressful environment. They also lack access to mental health services. In half of the U.S. counties, there is no psychiatrist or psychologist.
According to a 2016 @CDCGov report, people working in agriculture had one of the highest rates of suicide, due to the nature of their work and the lack of access to mental health care professionals in rural America.
Farm work is noble, but it can take its toll. I am proud to represent and support some of Minnesota’s rural communities, which is why I introduced the STRESS Act last Congress.
On Thanksgiving, it's important to remember and be grateful for those who produce all the food our families enjoy, both today and every day. Farmers and ranchers work endlessly to ensure our grocery stores are full and our children are nourished.

Representative @NickZerwas has been the embodiment of what a citizen legislator should be. A leader in Saint Paul, Representative Zerwas has tackled some of the biggest issues facing Minnesota.

Great discussion this morning. The US-Cuba relationship is critical to our economy. I'll keep pushing to lift the embargo and break through for a new chapter in our two nations' history. #CubaTrade
The embargo is a failed policy. There is huge economic potential (nearly $2 billion for American farmers) if we open up trade with our neighbors 90 miles off the Florida coast. #CubaTrade
Sen. @JohnBoozman rightly points out that today our farmers are in a situation where nearly all commodity prices are low. Opening up bilateral trade with Cuba is a win-win for ag. #CubaTrade

Today, Congress has the opportunity to expand, not the law, but rather, and instead, the number of Americans who can own a own home, or start their own business. #HMDAA
CFPB’s “double the data” rule is not just ineffective and costly, it also poses a threat to Americans’ privacy and data security. We must pass #HMDAA to give relief to Main Street banks and credit unions in Minnesota and across the country.
Due to the increased cost of compliance with the CFPB’s “double the data” rule – an estimated additional $326 million - many small banks in Minnesota are reconsidering their ability to continue to make mortgages and other covered loans. #HMDAA
Over the years the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act has expanded away from its original intent (to eliminate discriminatory lending). Dodd-Frank’s CFPB created a rule in 2015 to move it even further - requiring more than DOUBLE the data required to be reported. #HMDAA
Some laws have proven helpful to Americans who want a chance at the American Dream. Others have created obstacles by codifying government overreach. #HMDAA

The time has come to put healthcare back in the hands of the American people by allowing them to choose their own doctors and coverage.
In MN, Blue Cross Blue Shield suffered major losses as a result of Obamacare’s failures, forcing them to drop individual plans.
As a result of these rising costs, many families have opted to go uninsured, rather than pay for these skyrocketing costs.
In MN alone, premiums have increased nearly 67% for 2017. Minnesotan families cannot, and should not, have to shoulder those costs.
.@POTUS was at the Capitol today in a last ditch effort to save Obamacare. But I can think of a few major reasons why it MUST be repealed…
