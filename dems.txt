The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt.
We will continue to monitor the situation and work with the state parties to allow for flexibility around how states elect their delegates to the national convention once delegates are allocated based on primary or caucus results.
States need to adopt critical vote by mail safeguards to protect the right to vote for all voters: https://t.co/KEYqTRmHE4
In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the @DNC are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.
As we all deal with the uncertainty of #COVID19, it is *critical* that states provide clarity about upcoming primaries and caucuses. States can provide easy access to voting while protecting the health and safety of the American people.

@DNC These early and critical investments in campaign staff, organizers, and offices will ensure we’re reaching out to every possible voter we can starting *right now.* This is how we defeat Donald Trump on November 3 and elect a Democrat to the White House.
@DNC Here’s just some of what we’ll be doing to ensure big victories on November 3:  • Roughly doubling the number of on-the-ground organizers across these battleground states • Funding on-the-ground data staff  • Funding offices across the states
@DNC This is a historic investment in battleground states — one that wasn't in place at this point in the last presidential campaign cycle.
@DNC Early investments like these are essential in running effective programs in states. Hiring, onboarding, and training key staff members ensures our eventual nominee will inherit a rock-solid campaign infrastructure to scale up quickly once the general election begins.
🚨We have *BIG* news to share! 🚨The @DNC is proud to announce a new, multi-million dollar investment across six battleground states — AZ, FL, MI, NC, PA, and WI — to continue laying the groundwork for our eventual nominee and Democrats up and down the ballot to win in November.

Americans want a fair trial in the Senate — one that carefully considers all of the evidence that is directly relevant to the charges filed against Trump.   We need you to speak out now. Add your name to support a fair impeachment trial:
Nearly 70% of Americans agree that the impeachment trial should include testimony from key witnesses — exactly what @senatemajldr is hoping his rules will help prevent.   Make no mistake: We deserve to see a fair trial.
McConnell wants to prevent the Senate from calling witnesses. A fair trial *must* have them, which is why we *must* hear from key witnesses who have potentially critical information about Trump’s abuse of power.

The Trump administration must approve the governor’s request for a major disaster declaration in Puerto Rico. It is reprehensible to continue withholding funds from our fellow Americans in need.
It's clear that the key to success this year is working together — with organizations, campaigns, and supporters united behind our common goals: defeating Donald Trump and electing Democrats nationwide.
Here’s just some of what the @DNC is doing to win the White House and seats across the map this year:  • Organizing earlier than ever before in key battleground states • Providing campaigns at every level with top-notch voter data and tech • Defending access to the ballot box
It’s imperative that Republicans join Democrats in taking election security seriously. We owe it to the American people to ensure our elections are free, fair, and decided by the will of the voters.
Health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. Retweet this if you’re ready to elect Democrats this year and beyond to protect quality, affordable health care from Republican attacks.

RT @SeemaNanda: Google’s new policy restricting targeted ads does nothing to combat misinformation and harms our ability to reach grassroot…
We invite these companies to engage in an open and transparent conversation about how we effectively regulate political advertising online. Call us, @Googlepubpolicy, @twittergov, and @facebook.
We call on these tech companies to reconsider their decision to bluntly limit political advertising on their platforms. We view this as critical to combating the spread of disinformation, while maintaining our ability to empower voters with accurate information.
We must combat the spread of disinformation without harming civic engagement or limiting the ability of campaigns to connect directly with voters. Tech companies shouldn’t reduce the power of the grassroots just because it’s easier than addressing abuse on their platforms.
Tech companies must play a more active role in regulating the content on their platforms, and we stand in full support of tech platforms removing demonstrably false content and instituting better transparency standards.
However, a blanket ban on all political advertising is a cop-out that fails to combat disinformation and harms voters’ ability to participate in our democracy, affecting voters of color in particular.
There is no doubt that big tech companies like @Google, @Twitter, and @facebook need to take significant steps to regulate political advertising, which has gone completely unchecked in recent years, enabling the spread of disinformation.

@UofCalifornia @cjrotunno Since 2012, #DACA has provided work authorization and protection from deportation to 800,000 young people, allowing them to better support themselves and their families. #HomeIsHere
@UofCalifornia @cjrotunno 86 metro areas in the U.S. are home to *at least* 1,000 #DACA recipients. These individuals make our communities and our country stronger. Join us today at rallies across the country to support them. #HomeIsHere

@UofCalifornia @cjrotunno #DACA recipients make valuable contributions to our economy, paying $5.7 billion in federal taxes and $3.1 billion in state and local taxes each year. They are a vital part of our communities. #HomeIsHere

And Democrats will always stand with Native Americans in fighting to protect the sovereignty of Indian nations.
We must confront the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, because there should be no more stolen sisters or brothers, daughters or sons.
Democrats support priorities for Native Americans, including education and language revitalization funding, land rights, internet access, and economic development.
The sacrifice of Native Americans who serve our country in the armed forces at a higher rate than any other ethnic group makes us safer, and the service of our first Native American women members of Congress, @sharicedavids and @Deb4CongressNM, helps make us a more perfect union.
This Native American Heritage Month, we honor the innumerable and invaluable contributions of the first peoples of this continent.

There is absolutely no moral justification for Trump’s cruel anti-immigrant policies. At a time where our nation needs a president who will unite us, all Trump wants to do is attack Latinx and immigrant communities.
As Trump visits Florida today, remember that he promised voters he would leave Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security untouched. Instead, he’s proposed massive cuts.  One of the best ways we can stop these incessant attacks is by sending Trump and Republicans packing in 2020.

Social Security has provided a foundation of economic stability for millions of Americans since it was signed into law in 1935. That’s why Democrats will continue to fight to strengthen Social Security and expand its benefits.
Social Security is incredibly important for people of color. Without Social Security, 52% of African American seniors and 46% of Latino seniors would have lived in poverty in 2017.
Social Security is more than just a retirement program. 75% of Social Security recipients are retired workers and their families, 16% are disabled workers and dependents, and 9% are survivors.
This June, more than 63 million Americans collected Social Security benefits. That’s about 1 in every 6 Americans. And about one-quarter of seniors rely on Social Security for at least 90% of their income.
Today, we celebrate the 84th anniversary of the Social Security Act. Social Security is more than just a retirement program. Millions of Americans rely on it for disability and life insurance; it gives peace of mind to Americans in all walks of life. Just take a look ⤵️ https://t.co/m6lHGWcWjy

At the DNC, we know that the best way to build a robust, well-resourced party is from the ground up through grassroots support. Two-thirds of our organization’s fundraising last cycle came from supporters giving $200 or less.

The LGBTQ community forms a critical voting bloc that can help sweep out the forces of regression and bigotry across this country. Voting has never been more important. In the spirit of Stonewall, it’s time to press back. — George Takei

DNC Chair @TomPerez hit the road with Black women leaders like DNC Vice Chair @TeamKCP, DNC Black Caucus Chair #VirgieMRollins, DNC Women’s Caucus Chair #LottieShackelford, Reps. @VoteYvette, @JacksonLeeTX18, &amp; @LisaBRochester.
We recruited, trained, and engaged with more than 2,200 Black women who joined us in organizing activities that ranged from voter registration drives to phone banks and community canvasses.
Last year, we traveled to more than 20 states and talked to thousands of Black women about issues that mattered most to them. Atop that list was equal pay for equal work, ending systemic racism, and ending violence against women.

This important legislation ensures that renters in the Bay Area and the nation cannot be evicted from their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We must ensure that everyone has access to quality housing no matter their financial situation.
As more workers lose their jobs or have hours limited, families are at risk of missing rent or forgoing food on the table. We can’t allow people to be on the streets in the middle of a public health crisis — that’s why I helped introduce the Rental Eviction Moratorium Act.
Amid the chaos we cannot forget what we’re fighting for — a living wage, quality health care, affordable housing, and food on the table for everyone.
A quick recap:  House Democrats are fighting to slow the spread of the virus, ensure our health care workers are safe, and make sure communities are taken care of.  Trump has denied a public health crisis, spread misinformation, spewed racist remarks, and refused to act.

As the coronavirus continues to impact families across the country, I know how difficult this time is. But I’ve also been inspired by all the stories I’ve seen about neighbors helping neighbors and communities uplifting one another. Together, we can get through this.

Make no mistake: the Coronavirus will not affect everyone equally. Low-income workers, un- or under-insured people, those without stable housing, and undocumented communities will bear the brunt of this crisis.   We must build an economy that works for all in times of emergency.
Amid all the chaos, we cannot forget that the 2020 Census is up and running! Every single person needs to be counted. Get counted at https://t.co/4aGNNMb8CD
Happy St. Patrick’s Day everyone! 🍀  If you can, consider ordering take out (not dining in) from a local Irish business in your community. We could all use a helping hand during these difficult times.
COVID-19 is affecting all of us, especially small businesses and low-income communities. If you can, consider helping out one of these local Bay Area nonprofits:  https://t.co/gPicLAygRF
Stop this! Hoarding important items like this just prevents others from getting the supplies they need.  https://t.co/jftLShdXBG
😷 Always cover your cough or sneeze.  🧽 Disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (phones, laptops, remote controls, door knobs, and light switches come to mind).  ❤️ Take care of yourself and your family.
As Coronavirus spreads, here are some important things you should do:  👏 Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (that’s two rounds of Happy Birthday).  🙅🏿‍♀️ Don’t touch your face! I know it’s hard, but keep unwashed hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Taking food out of the mouths of hungry people during a global public health crisis is just plain cruel.   Glad that we blocked Trump’s dangerous SNAP cuts during the #coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/jaelVsVQVG
This is a hard time for many, especially low-income communities. If you can, please consider donating to the Alameda County Food Bank: https://t.co/F9FJaPMJcT
🗣️Once more for the people in the back: Trump does NOT have Congressional authority to go to war with Iran.  https://t.co/UnkUY2Je44
When asked how many women will be enough on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg always said, "nine."  "People are shocked. But there’d been nine men, and nobody’s ever raised a question about that."  Happy Birthday, RBG!
This is a step in the right direction, but still not enough. Families shouldn’t have to choose between paying rent, putting food on the table, or paying their medical bills during a public health crisis. https://t.co/oZE0DWwdAO
While American families are struggling during a pandemic, 40 GOP House members voted AGAINST the #FamiliesFirstAct. Is your representative on this list? Make sure you call them to let them know how disappointed you are.  https://t.co/MIfJjlEEO1
THIS is what the GOP was fighting against in the #FamiliesFirstAct:  — Expanding unemployment benefits — Expanding SNAP, WIC and child nutrition benefits — Expanding emergency funds for Medicaid — Expanding aid to hospital workers
Proud to pass the #FamiliesFirstAct to give Americans the relief and support they deserve during this critical time. While we didn’t pass everything we wanted (full paid sick leave), I have no doubt this will help communities nationwide. https://t.co/quCAm55o7S
Let’s not forget that marginalized communities are much more vulnerable to #COVID-19. Low-income communities might not have access to high quality health care or can’t afford to take off work.  First step: universal paid sick leave.
Americans don’t want another war.  Trump’s continuous and reckless military actions, without Congressional approval or authorization, caused this crisis.  We must return to diplomacy, repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, and stop endless war. https://t.co/1KxcQ44ren
Trump’s failed leadership has very real life-or-death consequences for everyday families. Despite a pandemic, Trump is blocking low-income people from getting health care coverage. It’s outrageous.  https://t.co/3JlEcIbuPY
Make no mistake: people will die because of Trump's white nationalist policies. https://t.co/xA0lV3Otfv
Thoughts and prayers won’t solve issues like gun violence, climate change, and global pandemics. We need real action. Now.
It’s crucial that we take proper precautions to address the #COVID-19 outbreak, but we cannot forget how actions like college closures affect students. Now, more than ever, we must support low-income students who rely on schools for housing, food, &amp; income.https://t.co/OADT9LWRZO
It’s not up for discussion — there is no excuse for xenophobia and racism. https://t.co/V0NgmhYpRG
Together, we can turn our Progressive agenda into a reality and build an America that works for everyone.
I’m proud of House Democrats for acting quickly in the wake of the #COVID-19 outbreak.   Our bill will expand: — free coronavirus testing — paid sick leave — unemployment benefits — SNAP food assistance
Climate change is real. We need a #GreenNewDeal. It’s as simple as that.
Every American deserves paid sick leave.
There would be no Democratic Party without African American women. It’s time we have one as our Vice President.

Insurance companies shouldn’t make a profit from sick people. That’s why we need #MedicareForAll.
Happy Holi to all of our friends celebrating! May the festival of colors spread joy, peace, and happiness around the world.
It's been one year since the House passed the #ForThePeopleAct, which would expand voting rights, limit gerrymandering, &amp; reduce money in politics.   It's been sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk ever since because he refuses to hold a vote in the Senate. It’s time to change that.

In a 24 hour news cycle, we cannot forget what we’re fighting for — Medicare for All, reproductive freedom, climate action, and justice for all.

The narrative that somehow women are less electable than men seems to still be an issue. It’s very disgusting really.   Women are electable when we vote for them.
On this day, 55 years ago, police attacked protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery.

Betsy DeVos is failing our students by cutting thousands of dollars in aid for some of the poorest, most rural districts in the country. All of our children deserve an equal chance at success, but DeVos only cares about pleasing her wealthy friends.  https://t.co/gDSi2tR2Hp

Abortion is health care. No matter what the Trump Administration and right-wing Supreme Court throws our way, I will never stop fighting for the basic right of controlling your own body.
When someone working 40 hours a week cannot afford basic needs like housing, health care, and food — our system has failed.   We must come together to create an economy where the minimum wage is a living wage.
Mike Pence failed Indiana and contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in the state’s history. He has no business leading a national effort to protect our public health.  https://t.co/ZLENJKbjzo

As we close out #BlackHistoryMonth, let’s remember that Black history is American history. From the medical industry to the arts, and everything in between, the contributions made my African Americans should be celebrated every month.
I cannot believe the sheer amount of ignorance that comes with saying impoverished Americans live very well.   This is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever struggled to get by.  https://t.co/eBzDKvjRiK
Over and over again, Congress asks Betsy DeVos for reports on why Black and Latino children are punished more than white students. But it's clear she doesn't care about stopping these babies from being punished.  It’s time for her to go. https://t.co/lDdZkhSxcq
Betsy DeVos has spent her entire career doing nothing but hurting students of color, low-income students, students with disabilities, and students who’ve experienced sexual assault.  She must be stopped.

I can’t believe this still needs to be said in 2020, but everyone deserves access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care — and that includes abortion.  No one should be forced to travel over 200 miles to receive a legal procedure.  https://t.co/PZ2dUx4CK6
We don’t talk about diaper need enough.   Nearly one-third of parents cannot afford regular baby diapers. My #EndDiaperNeed Act would create a $100 million fund for distributing free diapers to low-income families.

On this day in 1942, the U.S. government authorized the internment of over 110,000 Japanese Americans.  Today, Trump is banning people from entering the U.S. from Muslim countries.  “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.”
Democrats are doing everything we can to eliminate poverty and expand assistance programs, while Trump is threatening to cut food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, and more that millions of families rely on.   We will fight back.

2 in 5 Americans can’t afford a $400 emergency. A parking ticket, medical bill, or home repair could leave someone broke and in mountains of debt. An unlivable minimum wage combined with rising housing costs are failing American families. https://t.co/DdsLk9yLjy
Student homelessness has more than doubled in 15 years due to racial wealth gaps, low minimum wages, affordable housing shortages, and even climate change causing devastating natural disasters.  Our kids deserve better. We must act. https://t.co/LawxpI6KGo
The Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies are killing people. We should all be ashamed.  https://t.co/p30juyffMv
Today is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects communities of color and if we’re serious about ending this epidemic, then we need to address the treatment and prevention inequality perpetuated by institutionalized discrimination.
Too many families have to choose between paying the bills or putting food on the table. Instead of helping to expand assistance for those living in poverty, the GOP wants to kick millions off basic programs like Social Security and food stamps. It’s shameful.
“We won’t die from old age, we’ll die from climate change.” “Why should I study for a future I won’t have?”  “Why should I be in school if the world is burning?”  The climate crisis is robbing a generation of their future. We must act.  https://t.co/u4jcsSROBf
If Trump really cared about communities of color, he would uplift policies like affordable housing, a living wage, and quality health care.  But until then, he’s paying lip service and hoping you won’t notice.  https://t.co/8laXIwraWj
This is long overdue and sadly, still out of reach for many members of the LGBTQ community. It’s time we stop criminalizing and stigmatizing people for who they love.  https://t.co/L1R8B4DUyj
Affordable housing. A living wage. Food on the table.   Make no mistake: these are basic human rights.
FACT CHECK: Trump is attacking poor people — not poverty. His policies have ripped families off of welfare, denied them food stamps, and deepened the racial wealth gap.  https://t.co/RhkbStO1vk
In the richest nation on Earth, no child should be left without a home — but the number of homeless students is drastically rising. 1️⃣ We must make significant investments to end the affordable housing crisis. 2️⃣ We must make the minimum wage a living wage https://t.co/HfiAATFeIN
Yesterday, Senate Republicans proved that they’re too weak to stand up for what’s right. Let’s make sure they’re out of a job come November.
In the face of Trump and a dysfunctional Republican party, we can and must elect Democrats up and down the ballot. This is our chance to put our country back in the hands of qualified, compassionate public servants. We can’t afford to miss it.
Today would have been Trayvon Martin’s 25th birthday. My prayers are with his family, but actions are just as important — we must keep fighting against inequality and injustice in our country.
The Republican-led Senate just acquitted Trump of all impeachment charges.  It’s clear Trump abused his office for his own political gain. But Mitch McConnell and his rank-and-file yes-men pushed through a sham of a trial to protect the president at all costs.  It’s infuriating.
1 in 3 college students don’t have enough to eat. That’s unacceptable.  We must make food on college campuses more accessible. On top of that, we must make college more affordable so families have the resources to support basic food security. https://t.co/8TOXmgul0H
African Americans make up 13% of the nation’s population but account for 52% of our homeless population.  We must make critical investments in affordable housing to tackle this disturbing racial disparity and ensure everyone has a roof over their head. https://t.co/swH69pGJTV
Last night, we heard Trump try to paint a positive picture of his presidency. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. He is an impeached president who is a national security threat — pushing cruel, inhumane, &amp; extreme policies that undermine the very fabric of our nation.
The *real* #SOTU:  GOP: ❌Blocks common-sense gun reform ❌Gives tax cuts to the wealthy ❌Tries to sabotage health care  Democrats: ✅Most diverse Congress ever ✅Introduced over 400 bills to help everyday families ✅Saved health care &amp; protections for pre-existing conditions
Today, on Rosa Parks’s birthday, we honor this civil rights leader's incredible fight for justice. Everyday, I’m grateful for Rosa Parks, who paved a difficult path toward equality for me and many others. Today, we continue our fight in her legacy. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/8QBVc9NSgA

A bus is so much more than a bus.  It’s a lifeline for a single mom living in the only community she can afford while the only job she can find is 45 minutes away and the only grocery store is 30 minutes away.  We must invest more in public transit. #TransitEquityDay
Yesterday, two women died in a college shooting in Texas. My heart is breaking for the victims and their families. The gun violence epidemic has devastated communities, ripped apart families, &amp; taken too many lives.    How many more, Mitch McConnell? https://t.co/UYo908SKDz
The path to homelessness can be as simple as a large medical bill forcing someone to get behind on rent payments.  If we’re serious about ending the homeless crisis, we must enact structural change — from the health care industry to the minimum wage to affordable housing.

Our children and grandchildren are counting on us to make the world a better place for them. That means taking serious action on climate change before it’s too late.  https://t.co/qXyFndKlAe
Medicare for All isn’t just some progressive pipe dream. Our current system is expensive and frustrating for too many families. We won’t stop fighting until health care is a fundamental right for everyone — not just the wealthy.

In what world does it make sense to ban abortion, limit contraceptives, and deny students sex education, all while depriving young mothers of the necessary resources to live successful lives? The pro-life movement is nothing but hypocrisy.
Young people today have to dig themselves out of mountains of debt before they can even start to think about growing their wealth. It’s time we made some serious changes so our young people are set up to succeed. https://t.co/0YbgFAyAFp
Today starts #BlackHistoryMonth. From the medical industry to the arts, and everything in between, African Americans built this country. These contributions should not only be celebrated this month, but every month — because Black history is American history.
More than two million children are homeless in America. That’s unacceptable. Permanent, affordable housing should be a basic human right.

RT @RoKhanna: The executive branch has used the AUMF to get us involved in military conflicts without a vote in Congress for far too long.…
It’s time the House reassert our Constitutional authority to declare war and peace. I’m proud the House passed my bill to sunset the 2002 AUMF and @RoKhanna’s bill to stop funding for a war in Iran. #NoWarWithIran
Today, the House is voting on my bill to repeal the 2002 Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq. Trump has falsely claimed that the 2002 AUMF gives him the authorization to use military force in Iran.  The House must do our job to stop him.
11 years ago, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law, helping to ensure that all Americans are paid equally and fairly. But women, especially women of color, are still paid less than their male counterparts. We must keep fighting for equality in the workplace.
Trump’s travel ban is cruel and does not reflect the rich diversity of our country.   I’m proud to support the #NOBANAct in the House which would end Trump’s discriminatory travel ban on majority Muslim countries as well as asylum seekers.
This is absurd. Families shouldn’t be barred from receiving a  green card because they need public assistance like food stamps or Medicare. I’m extremely disappointed in this decision — we must keep fighting back against Trump’s atrocious policies. https://t.co/E6Zsfi5Fkm

13 million children live below the poverty line and 2/3 of those children are people of color. In the wealthiest nation in the world, there is no reason any child should ever go hungry.  We HAVE the tools to eradicate child poverty, we just need the political will to do it.
There is not a single county in the U.S. where the average cost of living and the average Social Security benefit are equal.  Already, our nation’s seniors are struggling to get by and Republicans want to cut Social Security? It's outrageous and cruel. https://t.co/vNGpbcNm7A
My heart is breaking for the families of Kobe Bryant and others who tragically lost their lives in a helicopter accident. California lost a great person today. Keeping everyone in my prayers.

I hated politics until I met Shirley Chisholm. After she scolded me for not being registered to vote, she inspired me to work on her 1972 presidential campaign and eventually run for office myself. I'm forever grateful for her mentorship. I would not be here without her.

Shirley Chisholm is often remembered for being the first African American woman elected to Congress. But she should also be remembered for what she accomplished. She was instrumental in creating the national school lunch program, expanding food stamps, and establishing WIC.
The GOP tax cuts are a sham to deepen the pockets of the already wealthy and everyday Americans paid the price. #VoteThemOut https://t.co/vqK8NxwQFZ
Shirley Chisholm launched her historic campaign for president today in 1972. She inspired women of color, including me, to get involved in politics. Today, we honor her legacy by continuing to fight for seats at the table. And if they won’t make room, we’ll bring folding chairs. https://t.co/puPJsSHr6q

Three years ago, Trump not only reinstated the Global Gag Rule, but radically and dangerously expanded it, threatening global health and undermining local efforts to save lives and expand reproductive rights. Doctors should be able to talk freely with their patients. Period.
We now have refugees fleeing their home countries to escape the deadly consequences of climate change.  Make no mistake: the climate crisis will create a racial wealth gap where the rich can pay to escape while low-income folks are forced to stay. https://t.co/vYNRPOMfCj

The American people deserve a real trial, not a cover-up.
The Hyde Amendment was designed to *specifically* prevent low-income communities and communities of color from accessing abortion care. That’s wrong.   I’ve introduced the #EACHWomenAct to overturn Hyde once and for all.
On the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, let’s remember that women aren’t the only people who get abortions. Trans men need access to the full range of reproductive services, too.
Low-income folks and people of color will suffer the most if Roe v. Wade is overturned. This is a threat to human rights and reproductive rights. We’ve come too far to turn back now.
Thank you for sharing your stories. Repubicans will never get rid of abortion — only safe and legal abortion. #KeepAbortionLegal https://t.co/7Aoqiezz7u
Yesterday’s start of the Senate impeachment trial was an absolute sham. The American public deserves to hear firsthand from witnesses and see all relevant information pertaining to the impeachment of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/IyfZj0ouAg
On the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we remember all the women who came before us and the dark days of back-alley abortions. We must never return to those days of shadows, shame, and silence. We must recommit ourselves to fight for people’s right to a safe and legal abortion.
Students defrauded by predatory colleges are left with crushing debt, useless degrees, and none of the jobs they were promised. All while Betsy DeVos enriches these dangerous for-profit colleges.  I will continue to defend defrauded students and block DeVos' harmful policies.

Slavery will forever be a stain on our nation’s history and even today, racism plagues every facet of our society. So on National Day of Racial Healing, let us recognize how far we have come — but remember how much farther we have to go to achieve true equality for all.
While we have come far thanks to Dr. King and all those who sacrificed so much during the Civil Rights Movement, it is more apparent than ever that we still have a long way to go to achieve civil rights, freedom, and justice for all. #MLKDay
Dr. King named three evils in America: the evil of racism, the evil of poverty, and the evil of militarism.  Racism and white supremacy still plague our nation, too many Americans remain trapped in poverty, and our country is caught in a cycle of violence and endless war.
On #MLKDay, we remember the life of a civil rights icon, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Through his tireless activism and deep commitment to justice, Dr. King inspired our nation and our world to fulfill the promise of freedom and equality for all. Let's keep his legacy alive. https://t.co/AHL1pwoz5o

It is a myth that most homelessness is caused by mental health, addiction, or substance use. Most homelessness is driven by economic forces. Until we end the stigma and stop blaming folks for things outside their control, we will never end the homeless crisis in California.
Poverty kills. Not having money means not being able to afford appointments, medicine, and treatments. Not having money means not having time for health and wellness activities.  We must prioritize ending our nation's wealth gap. https://t.co/042VJLODY7
Don’t forget that the Trump administration is still trying to rip essential SNAP benefits away from hundreds of thousands of families. This fight is personal: as a single mother raising two sons, I depended on food stamps too. We cannot let Trump get away with this.

In 2019, the Democratic House passed nearly 400 bills that sat on Mitch McConnell’s desk collecting desk in the GOP-controlled Senate. In 2020, let’s make sure we take our government back.

No war with Iran. Sign your name now → https://t.co/u5YfEBiP17

Climate change is a health emergency and the Trump administration is not only ignoring the reality of the crisis, but they’re doing everything they can to exacerbate it. This is extremely dangerous.  https://t.co/DMwBLCsdHF
The climate crisis is wreaking havoc across our globe. People are dying or being displaced as a result of these climate disasters.  We cannot wait any longer to act. This should be an alarm bell for all — we must drastically lower CO2 before it’s too late. https://t.co/BG7QLP1kPu
Congress has a responsibility to reassert their Constitutional authority to declare war and peace now more than ever. I’ve introduced several bills to repeal the AUMF, which gives presidents blank checks for endless war. It’s time we follow through. https://t.co/PHLIv31Rl9
🗣️ Trump 🗣️ does 🗣️ not 🗣️ have 🗣️ Constitutional 🗣️ authority 🗣️ to 🗣️ go 🗣️ to 🗣️ war 🗣️ with 🗣️ Iran.

For all those celebrating, I hope you and yours have a very Merry Christmas!
This Christmas Eve, I can’t help but think about all the immigrant families who can’t be together because the Trump administration separated them at the border, locked their children in cages, or raided their communities.   Let’s not forget their stories.
Happy Monday. Abolish ICE.

Don’t let this circus of a White House distract you from what we’re fighting for: a living wage, affordable housing, free education, and quality health care for all.
Trump is packing our courts with right-wing judges to reshape the bench for generations to come. Everything from women’s rights to health care to immigration hangs in the balance.  In 2020, we must vote like our lives depend on it — because they do. https://t.co/62j46LGUsq
African Americans make up only 8% of LA County’s population, but represent 60% of the homeless population. Redlining has forced folks into the poorest neighborhoods or out on the streets. We must address this racism if we hope to tackle the housing crisis. https://t.co/t8vP8wnehF
Today in 2010, President Obama signed an order repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This marked the end of a discrimination against gay, lesbian, &amp; bisexual servicemembers.  But under Trump, trans servicemembers have been barred from serving. Our fight for full equality is not over.
Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating across the country! Wishing you and your family a holiday filled with happiness and love.
Families all across the country are without housing — not because they did something wrong, but because the cost of living is too high and wages are too low.  The next president MUST make affordable housing a top priority for their administration. https://t.co/gUkhgNyPXs
Two years ago, the GOP passed one of the worst tax bills in history.  They promised to give everyday families a break but instead, they gave massive tax cuts to corporations &amp; the top 1% — leaving everyone else in the dust.  The GOP played folks for fools. We should be outraged.
Since the day Betsy DeVos stepped into office, she’s made it clear that she cares more about profits than students. Time for her to go. https://t.co/WfhCxEiRwz

Families across the country rely on food stamps to make ends meet and put food on the table. But the Trump administration treats them like a bunch of statistics thrown into a report — anything they can cut to deepen the pockets of their wealthy friends.  It’s disgusting.
Seeking asylum is a human right.   This administration's anti-immigrant agenda is growing worse by the day.  https://t.co/Uw2rtlFczf

Yesterday, the House voted to impeach Trump. Now, it’s up to the Senate to hold a fair hearing of the facts — anything less is beneath the office they serve.
I just joined my colleagues in voting to impeach President Trump. No one is above the law and the evidence of corruption against Trump only grows by the day. I hope my colleagues in the Senate do the right thing and place country over party during the trial.
On International Migrants Day, let’s remember the harrowing journey many migrants make to escape extreme hunger, violence, and sexual abuse all for the chance of a better life for their children.   Immigrant rights are human rights.

Tomorrow the House will vote on impeachment. It is with grave sadness that I will vote yes. Impeachment is never easy for a country. But I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and protect this nation I love from corruption. Donald Trump is not fit for the office he serves.
This is unacceptable. Voters should be able to have the confidence that their party registration will always remain accurate. Just another reason why we must increase our investments in election security and accuracy.  https://t.co/L5OsLuX5mv
More than 80% of current members of Congress weren’t in office when the 2001 AUMF became law. And now the Afghanistan Papers prove just how much damage a blank check for endless war can do. It's past time to repeal the 2001 AUMF.
Raise the wage. Legalize marijuana. Make college free.  Pass Medicare for All.

The tricks that Big Pharma pulls on everyday Americans is outrageous.  I was proud to join House Democrats yesterday in passing H.R. 3 to expand Medicare to cover vision, dental, and hearing for the first time and to lower the costs of prescription drugs for everyday families.

The repeal of the 2001 Authorization of the Use of Military Force and repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF are noticeably absent from the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act. It also includes unnecessary and record Pentagon spending levels.  In good conscience, I could not vote yes.
And now the Afghanistan Papers prove what most of us knew all along: our government lied to us about the war in Afghanistan, took thousands of lives, and wasted $1 trillion.  It's past time to pass my legislation repealing the 2001 AUMF. https://t.co/mx3G36neLM
I was the only member of Congress to vote against the AUMF, a 60-word blank check for war. I was painted as unpatriotic. I was vilified in the press. I received death threats.  But I knew the damage unchecked war would cause, the lives it would take, the money it would waste.
I am delighted to partner with Rep. González-Colón in leading the Congressional HIV/AIDS Caucus. I look forward to working together to address the needs of communities disproportionately impacted by HIV as we continue working towards an AIDS-free generation.
I’m so proud of @GretaThunberg for being @TIME’s person of the year.  But the sad truth is she should be in school — getting to be a kid. The climate crisis is robbing her and a generation of their future. It’s time for us adults to start acting like the leaders our kids deserve.
Hate groups have flourished under the Trump administration. From Pittsburgh to Jersey City, anti-semitism attacks have should have no place in America. My heart is with all those affected by yesterday’s shooting in New Jersey. We must keep fighting back against this hate.

Proud to join my colleagues as we rally outside of the United States Department of Agriculture in protest of Trump’s cruel new SNAP policy that would rip benefits away from 700,000 Americans. We must pass the #ProtectSNAPAct.
On #HumanRightsDay, I encourage each and every one of my colleagues to ensure that human rights are a priority in Congress every day — from women’s rights to immigrants’ rights, every single person deserves respect, dignity, and humanity.
This is despicable. Three migrant children have already died from the flu while in U.S. custody and now Border Patrol agents are barring doctors from giving flu vaccinations.   This administration's anti-immigrant agenda is killing children.  https://t.co/qE0an6jq3c
The House just laid out articles of impeachment against President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of justice. Every day, the evidence of corruption against Trump grows and it’s our duty to uphold the Constitution. It’s time to move forward with impeachment.
The housing crisis is growing worse by the day — especially in California. I can’t tell you how many constituents I’ve met without a solid roof over their heads. We must do more to ensure that everyone has access to affordable housing.

It makes me sick. How dare this administration continue to deepen their pockets and profit off their policies while taking away food stamps from 700,000 needy people. It’s despicable.
Let’s not forget that people experiencing homelessness are *people*. They deserve compassion, understanding, and most importantly — a government who fights for their right to housing, food, health care, and a living wage.
This is outrageous.  Unless doctors perform an anti-abortion procedure that *does not exist* they could be charged with murder. This isn’t some dystopian future. This is right now.  The GOP is waging a war on women and we must fight to stop it. https://t.co/mj0vMNUUKd
The pro-life movement is nothing but hypocrisy. If the GOP truly cared about family values, they would support paid child leave, social services like Medicaid, ending maternity deaths — and they sure wouldn’t stand for ripping families apart at the border.

34% of Black children live in poverty — almost 3x that of whites. Black infants are more than twice as likely to die. Black mothers are 3-4x more likely to die from childbirth. Let’s speak the truth: racism is killing people.  We must act to rid racism from our institutions.
The Trump administration is locking away physically disabled, mentally ill, or LGBTQ immigrants in solitary confinement at higher rates than ever before.  Solitary confinement is barbaric and must only be used in the narrowest of circumstances. https://t.co/VHgUG2A3GI
Various health clinics have closed or are on the verge of closing because Trump’s #TitleXGagRule defunded any clinic that even *referred* abortions.  Now, thousands of low-income communities and people of color are left without any care. It's outrageous. https://t.co/nLxKakSlUe
We will not tolerate white nationalism. We will not be silent. Stephen Miller must resign.
This new California law, the first of its kind, will seek to eliminate obstacles for people needing HIV treatment. As usual, California is on the frontlines of progress, justice, and humanity. https://t.co/jNbw4FqHSX
Poverty is the main driver of health inequities. Minerva, Adrianne, and Diana are incredible doctors seeking to change that. We must follow their lead and ensure that everyone, especially low-income communities, has access to high quality health care. https://t.co/kLpYiibRbb
Trump’s immigration plans are xenophobic and racist — and they will also hurt our economy. It’s ridiculous how far this president will go to inflate his own ego.  https://t.co/FguiESRnsG
On this day in 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot and killed for playing with a toy gun. He should be alive today.   Today and every day, let’s recommit ourselves to ending police violence toward people of color.

As always, proud to stand by Governor @GavinNewsom as he leads California to #ActOnClimate! https://t.co/SwkmIsw1lR

Today is #LatinaEqualPayDay and a reminder that on average, Latina women make just 54 cents for every dollar white men make. That’s unacceptable. We must keep fighting for equal pay for equal work.
This critical bill will help right the wrongs of the failed and racist War on Drugs by expunging criminal convictions, reinvesting in communities of color through restorative justice, and promoting equitable participation in the legal marijuana industry.  https://t.co/XLm2O0Gekb
Trump’s appointed ambassador, Gordon Sondland, just said it himself: Rudy Guiliani pushed for a quid pro quo with Ukraine under Trump’s orders.  The evidence is clear. Trump abused his power to coerce a foreign government to help him win re-election.  https://t.co/P1AHYiy2Xg
PG&amp;E might shut off power across Northern California tomorrow and Thursday. Stay informed, learn if you’ll be affected, and plan ahead.  https://t.co/QqgWYIbLos

It is unjust that some CEOs of major corporations are making upwards of 1000 times more than their average employee. The Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act will incentivize companies to reduce the CEO-worker pay gaps and pay their workers the wages they deserve. https://t.co/NjHXhuE9bH
Since taking office, I’ve fought for a decent living wage, a quality and affordable college education, and for everyone to have access to health care.  And you better believe I’ll keep fighting.

Personal beliefs should never dictate patient care. Congress must pass the #PutPatientsFirst Act to ensure everyone from women seeking abortions to trans folks needing care are able to get what they need.

A bus is so much more than a bus.  It’s a lifeline for a single mom living in the only district she can afford while the only job she can find is 45 minutes away and the only grocery store is 30 minutes away.  We must invest more in public transit.
If companies can afford to pay their CEOs tens of millions of dollars, they can afford to raise wages for their employees.  #TaxCEOs.

The typical employee at McDonald’s would have to work for more than 2,000 years to earn what the company’s CEO received last year.  That's absurd!  I’m proud to introduce the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act with @BernieSanders and @RashidaTlaib.  It's time to pay workers or pay up.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: in the richest nation on Earth, there is no reason anyone anywhere should be living in poverty. We HAVE the tools to end poverty, our Republican counterparts just need the political will to do it.
As the House begins public impeachment hearings, I can assure you we will do whatever it takes to hold this president accountable. Impeachment is never an easy choice, but we made an oath to protect our country and uphold the Constitution. And that’s exactly what we’ll do.
I am heartbroken. Bernard dedicated his life to making health care more accessible for our communities. He led Kaiser to success, and never lost sight of his dream to make health care affordable. My condolences are with his family and loved ones. https://t.co/UYBbRGWBdd
Decriminalization of marijuana does not go far enough because people — mostly communities of color — will still be disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession. We must provide restorative justice to those communities affected by the failed #WarOnDrugs.
🗣️ We must act on climate change. Now.  https://t.co/Jp3tWSdMUQ
The path to homelessness can be as simple as a large medical bill forcing someone to get behind on rent payments.  If we’re serious about ending the homeless crisis, we must enact structural change — from the health care industry to the minimum wage to affordable housing.
The average #DACA recipient was just six-years-old when they came to the U.S.  Today, SCOTUS begins oral arguments to decide whether or not Trump can terminate DACA for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers. We MUST speak out for what's right and demand SCOTUS protect DACA.
Politicians should never stand between our veterans and their health care. That's why I introduced the Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe Harbor Act to empower veterans and their doctors to make informed decisions about the use of medical marijuana without political interference.

One year ago today, California lost 12 people in the Thousand Oaks mass shooting.  I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: lawmakers who are willing to trade the safety of our communities for cash from the gun lobby do not deserve the honor of serving in Congress.
The poorest Americans saw their income drop 7% over the past 15 years. That’s completely unacceptable. We must start passing policies that lift low-income communities up — not deepen the pockets of the already wealthy.  https://t.co/x5RGKiMmsy

Six years ago, Renisha McBride knocked on a door looking for help after a car accident. Instead, the man at the door shot and killed her. This is just one of the many tragic stories about African American women unjustly dying. We must continue to speak out about these injustices.

40% of Muslim students have been bullied in California schools. That is completely unacceptable. Hate crimes are on the rise in America. From white supremacist attacks to fear-mongering rhetoric, we cannot tolerate such hate — especially in our schools. https://t.co/5Of7nyqXgc
I stand in solidarity with the teachers on strike in Chicago. Educators dedicate their lives to preparing our next generation of leaders. They deserve a living wage, proper resources, and our support. https://t.co/CyOLPiNoKk
The acting White House Chief of Staff literally admitted that Trump withheld $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to pursue an investigation that would tilt the 2020 presidential election in Trump's favor. That’s quid pro quo and illegal. https://t.co/f61uW0Nuem
Christina Koch and Anne McClain are making history today as the first all-women spacewalk takes flight. Christina and Anne, you make us so proud and the entire country is with you! https://t.co/0stCAjBmMl
Quality education should never be determined by someone's wealth. We must pass the #CollegeAffordabilityAct to lower the cost of college for families, hold schools accountable, and grant students of color more scholarships through the new Ron Dellums STEAM program.
We need to get serious about tackling the climate crisis. It’s time we: 🌳 Pass the Green New Deal 💪🏿 Ensure justice for those hit hardest by climate change 🏞️ Stop drilling on public lands ☀️ Invest in renewable energy 🌎 Re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement
More than 40 million Americans live in poverty. On International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, let’s speak the truth and be clear: no family anywhere should be forced to live in poverty.
Trump’s decisions are reckless, destructive, and damaging to our global standing, our military interests, and our allies. Yesterday, the House passed a bipartisan resolution to condemn Trump’s actions in Syria.  https://t.co/VI0yA0XTll
America lost a force of good with the passing of Rep. Elijah Cummings. He was the true embodiment of a public servant and always fought for justice. His moral compass guided us toward a better world and his legacy will remain untouched. Rest in power, my friend.
Today is #WorldFoodDay, a time for us to recommit ourselves to ending global hunger. In the United States alone, 40 million people go hungry. What is the Trump administration doing about it? Cutting $4.5 billion in food stamps. It’s just plain wrong.
Happy birthday Planned Parenthood! For 103 years, Planned Parenthood has provided lifesaving healthcare to women in need. Thank you @PPFA for fighting back against the Trump Administration’s war on women — I’m right beside you.
A reminder that the House has passed over 100 bills that expand background checks for gun sales, strengthen voting rights, and more that Mitch McConnell has blocked in his legislative graveyard. #StopTheStonewalling
No one living in the richest nation on Earth should have to rely on COUPONS for medical care. It’s outrageous. We must pass #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/a2fvcmZjTf
17 years ago, based on false intel, Congress justified war with Iraq using the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Keeping the AUMF in effect 17 years later is dangerous and could lead to missions Congress never intended. It’s past time to get it off the books.
Once again, @KamalaHarris proved that she is the best candidate in this race to prosecute the case against Trump. Today and every day, I’m proud to stand by Kamala as she fights #ForThePeople. #DemDebate
No one should have to live in fear of becoming a victim in the next mass shooting. @KamalaHarris’ plan to tackle gun violence would mandate near-universal background checks and ban AR-15-style assault weapons.

In the wealthiest nation on Earth, it’s unacceptable that millions of Americans are living in poverty. We must work together to create an economy that works for everyone, not just a few.
1️⃣ Legalize marijuana at the federal level 2️⃣ Legitimize the industry with resources and banking opportunities  3️⃣Provide restorative justice to communities of color most impacted by the failed War on Drugs
California has filed 60 lawsuits against Trump. From climate change to immigration to health care, we're showing the country what progress looks like. https://t.co/3HR0pDzAda
Enough is enough. Access to reproductive care should never depend on how much money you have. We must repeal the Hyde Amendment once and for all.
Today and every day, we must fight to ensure that every girl across the globe has the opportunity to succeed and thrive in their communities. #DayOfTheGirl
California is on the frontlines of the fight for justice. High mandatory sentences and facial recognition technology undoubtedly discriminate against people of color. We will always fight back against the violation of civil rights. https://t.co/rqsj9EF74u
In celebration of National Coming Out Day, I want to say that I stand with every single LGBTQ individual no matter where they are in their journey. Love is love.
28 years ago today, Anita Hill bravely testified before the Senate about Clarence Thomas sexually harassing her. Last year, Christine Blasey Ford did the same against Brett Kavanaugh.  Both men made it onto the bench. We must do more to hear, believe, and respect survivors.

Happy birthday to my good friend Governor @GavinNewsom! Proud to stand by you as you continue to make progress in California.
It's clear the #GOPTaxScam deepened the pockets of the wealthy at the expense of everyday families.  For the first time in history, the 400 wealthiest Americans paid a lower total tax rate than any other income group last year.  We should be outraged. https://t.co/pbElPp90c0

A reminder that the minimum wage hasn’t increased in *10 years.* Together we must fight to make the minimum wage a living wage. No one working 40 hours a week should be forced to live in poverty.

My two boys and I received food stamps during a difficult period in my life and I know that I would not be where I am today without that help. Trump’s new proposal to cut SNAP benefits for the third time would leave millions hungry. It’s shameful. https://t.co/6akLmVmbwH

It’s no surprise that wealthier communities have more access to resources that help young people get ahead. We must break down the systemic barriers that keep low-income folks and students of color stuck at the bottom.  https://t.co/fEhZE0wJrq
Our government doesn’t even guarantee health care for its own citizens. This is nothing but xenophobic hate. https://t.co/3psTelTuOW

Nearly 12 million children live in poverty. Under no circumstances should that be acceptable in the richest nation on Earth. Shame on us.
18 years ago today, the endless War in Afghanistan began. Since then, we have lost countless lives in the Middle East. It’s past time to #BringOurTroopsHome and end America’s longest war.

Our country experiences far too many mass shootings. @KamalaHarris won’t sit around and wait for action on gun violence. If Congress fails to send her gun safety legislation within her first 100 days as president, she’ll take executive action.  https://t.co/gl5lbgu5bP
Don’t miss tonight’s Democratic presidential debate! Join me in cheering on @KamalaHarris by tuning in to @ABC at 5PM PT/8PM ET!

Today we remember the victims and the brave first responders of the 9/11 attacks. We must continue to usher in peace around the world and here at home.

62 years ago, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was signed into law. It aimed to increase voting protections for Black Americans but faced immense opposition and a majority of its provisions were rejected by Congress. We must continue to strive for racial equality at the voting booth.
On this day in 1965, the Department of Housing and Urban Development was founded. Today, we must do more to ensure that everyone everywhere has access to quality, affordable housing.
Congress is back in session today. The first thing McConnell should do is hold a vote on the multiple gun reform bills we’ve sent him to save lives and end this epidemic of violence.
You won’t find this in a history book. Hundreds of Black Americans were murdered 100 years ago. We won’t forget their stories. https://t.co/LBFLuCBf38
Happy birthday, California! On this day 169 years ago, California became the 31st state. Extremely proud our state continues to lead the way on environmental standards, civil rights, and immigrant protections.

The Trump administration is moving our country in the wrong direction. I sat down with @kron4news to discuss everything from the housing crisis to child poverty to health care. Watch now: https://t.co/NdXgfXBUXm
Climate change is about human rights.  African Americans have a 19% higher cancer death rate than their white counterparts. They're more likely to live in a polluted neighborhood. 1.2 million children, most in low-income areas, have lead in their blood.  It's about human rights.
Here’s how this works: 1️⃣ Trump redefines the standard for poverty 2️⃣ Less people fall under the poverty line 3️⃣ People who need government assistance are now unqualified to receive it 4️⃣ Trump reduces “poor people” but worsens poverty  https://t.co/eYTJhcE8kc

It’s on us to create a better world for our children by encouraging inclusivity and respect for human rights. That means calling out racism, xenophobia, and religious intolerance whenever and wherever we see it. That is our moral responsibility as human beings.

“We must dissent from the fear, the hatred, and the mistrust...because America can do better." — Thurgood Marshall  Today in 1967, Thurgood Marshall, a powerful voice for civil rights, became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. Let’s honor his legacy and do better.

The wealth gap in this country is out of control. The richest 1% of Americans own about 40% of the entire nation’s wealth and it’s only getting worse. It’s time for Wall Street to pay their fair share of taxes.
On International Day for Indigenous Peoples, let’s not forget our country’s painful past. From early colonization, to the Trail of Tears, to Trump’s attacks on tribal sovereignty, millions of Native Americans have died at the hands of disease and violence.
It’s been five years since Michael Brown, a young, unarmed Black man, was murdered by Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. His family still doesn’t have the justice they deserve. #BlackLivesMatter
Once again, the Trump administration is separating children from their parents. America should be ashamed.  https://t.co/JWi45OF35v
Here’s a list of things we could afford if Trump didn’t waste so much taxpayer money on unnecessary military spending: → #MedicareForAll → Debt-free College → Food stamps assistance → Infrastructure
Imagine the joy of having a baby only to realize you won’t be able to afford basic items for care like diapers. 1 in 3 families experience diaper need, which often leads to negative health outcomes. My #EndDiaperNeed Act would allocate $100 million to distribute free diapers.
Gun violence IS preventable. Background checks save lives. Banning assault weapons saves lives. The House has passed bills to end the gun violence epidemic but Trump and Republicans are stalling our progress.  https://t.co/TPbs7bEWZQ
The Trump administration has cut a massive $32.5 million from the United Nations Population Fund &amp; $210,000 from the Organization of American States, two organizations that support contraception, family planning, &amp; sexual and reproductive health all around the world. #StopTheBans
Alarm bells should be ringing! The climate crisis is destroying our planet and threatening our livelihoods while the Trump administration is pushing its anti-science agenda and burying climate reports. https://t.co/35EfdT5ajF
Pay up, Mr. President.  https://t.co/Jgp5gOBPZb
As a result of Trump’s ridiculous trade war, China will no longer buy U.S. agricultural products. Trump policies are directly hurting our economy, businesses, and most importantly, American families. Enough is enough.

Don’t let the president’s words fool you. This is the same guy who said there were “very fine people on both sides” after the Charlottesville attack in 2017. Since Day One, Trump has fanned the flames of racism and used dog whistle politics to divide us.  https://t.co/XltNpVtzJD

The El Paso shooter posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online before killing at least 20 people. Immigrants hurt in the shooting might even be avoiding hospitals for fear of deportation. This is the culture Trump has created and Republicans have enabled.
Today in 1965, President LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act into law to expand the right to vote. But ever since the Supreme Court gutted the #VRA, there has been rampant voter suppression across the country, disproportionately targeting communities of color. We must #RestoreTheVRA

The time for debate is over. Last month was the hottest on record. Enough of Republican stonewalling and foot dragging. The climate crisis is real and the American people deserve real solutions.
When your child is sick, you shouldn't have to worry about affording the medication. But our inadequate health care system forces too many families into that horrible position. We need to expand Medicaid to lift people out of poverty.
When our country only works for the top 1%, when wealthy special interests write checks to buy influence in our government, and when families are thrown under the bus — it’s time to change the system. Under Democratic leadership, everyday families are a priority.
The #DeathPenalty is barbaric, discriminatory, and error-prone. It's time to end this terrible practice and fix our broken criminal justice system.
I am horrified. Two mass shootings less than 24 hours apart. My heart goes out to El Paso and Dayton. We have sent McConnell TWO bills to help end the gun violence epidemic and he refuses to vote on either. Lives are at stake. We must ACT.
The federal minimum wage hasn’t moved from $7.25/hour in almost a decade. We need to give families the raise they deserve and increase the minimum wage to $15/hour.
I have spent my entire career fighting to #StopEndlessWars. We need leaders who will move us away from nuclear war, barbaric conflict, and needless civilian deaths. We need leaders who will focus on peace-keeping and democratic solutions to conflict.  https://t.co/UXcevjIAiy
Enough is enough. How many more tragedies must our country endure before we act on gun violence? My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with  El Paso but that is not enough. It’s time for action.

Climate change is *the* issue of our generation. We need to pass the #GreenNewDeal to upgrade our infrastructure, create millions of good-paying jobs, and move us toward 100% renewable energy before it’s too late.
Marijuana is a legitimate industry. And a legitimate industry should have legitimate access to banking services to start successful businesses. Especially for people of color who have been disproportionately incarcerated from marijuana criminalization.
I believe in the good of this country. I believe in the good of the American people. I believe we are better than Trump’s ugly racism aimed to divide us. When we stand together, our voices united, we are more powerful than this small-minded bigotry.
Imagine how cruel you have to be to make it harder for poor children to get enough food. That’s exactly who the Trump administration is hurting by cutting access to food stamps. It’s sickening. https://t.co/PiZ1XD5UvO
Medicare and Medicaid were created 54 years ago today as a promise that we would always take care of our nation’s most vulnerable. But Republicans are doing everything they can to dismantle these vital programs and deepen the pockets of wealthy special interests. It’s shameful.
Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, once said, “We must dissent from the fear, the hatred, and the mistrust...because America can do better."  Let’s heed his words and work to end injustices across this country. Let’s do better.
Two years ago, the GOP tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the Senate but millions of people called, wrote letters, and organized to save our care. They failed by one vote. This time, they’re taking their fight to the courts and we have just one thing to say about that: https://t.co/9Qi1rwaJRm
Trump’s bogus policy to force work requirements for Medicaid recipients completely misses the point. Every single person deserves access to high-quality health care.  https://t.co/BNsWU6pKKz

This president’s vile attacks on my friend and colleague, Representative Elijah Cummings and his district are ugly examples of racism, full stop. Trump and anyone in the GOP who watches him attack leaders of color in silence should be ashamed of themselves.

There are millions of people just one emergency away from living in poverty. The first step to tackling poverty is addressing the systemic barriers that keep low-income families, especially those of color, trapped at the bottom.

On this day in 2009, the minimum wage was raised to $7.25. It has yet to increase since. If only @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell would bring the #RaiseTheWage Act to a vote so we could more than double it to $15/hr.
Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller made it clear in his report and in his testimony today: the findings of his investigation did NOT exonerate President Trump from wrongdoing, period.

Trump’s Department of Agriculture wants to save money by forcing 3 million Americans off of food stamps. How about we tax Wall Street and get rid of those wasteful GOP tax cuts for the wealthy instead?

Our current healthcare system is failing American families. We need to pass Medicare for All so that no one has to choose between paying an exorbitant medical bill or putting food on the table.
We know @realDonaldTrump is racist. What we need to realize and address though is that his agenda is embraced by white supremacists, and that is dangerous.  https://t.co/iwT2iqq1K8
A $15 minimum wage means workers can sleep more and have less medical issues; women can afford birth control and teen pregnancy rates decrease; families don't have to live in fear that a traffic ticket prevents them from affording dinner that night. Raising the wage saves lives.
We are making real progress on finally stopping endless war. https://t.co/HOjGYLkJRy

More than 2,000 Californians died from opioid overdose in 2017. We need to start making some real investments in opioid abuse prevention and treatment before this crisis wrecks havoc on any more families.

Today in 1848, the first women’s rights convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York. While we honor the suffragettes’ long fight for justice and equality, we cannot forget that African American women were largely left out of this movement.

Imagine what our country would look like if gerrymandering and voter suppression weren’t so rampant in communities of color. We need to protect the right to vote and end partisan gerrymandering.
I was so disinterested in politics until I met Shirley Chisholm. After she scolded me for not being registered to vote, she inspired me to eventually run for office. I miss her every day — she taught me women of color deserve a rightful seat at the table. https://t.co/u5UZAyRiZc
This erratic president combined with his irrational need for conflict and love of “fake news” is leading us toward a dangerous war with Iran. The 2003 Iraq invasion was based on false information and we must not repeat history's terrible mistake. https://t.co/7aYlNIzIYh

More than 80% of current members of Congress weren’t in office when we voted on the 2001 AUMF. It's time to re-evaluate our priorities and repeal the 2001 AUMF now. #StopEndlessWar
Americans spend more on pharmaceutical drugs than anyone else in the world, and prices keep surging. I’m committed to lowering drug prices so no family has to suffer from Big Pharma’s greed.
Congrats #USWNT on winning the Women’s World Cup back to back! You all make us so proud. And after today, there’s no question — you clearly deserve equal pay. #OneNationOneTeam
The data is clear: food stamps help our country’s most vulnerable families escape hunger. It’s just plain cruel that the Trump administration is working to strip this lifeline from those who need it. https://t.co/hj2tFuhEJp
It’s shocking that Black mothers are 3-4x more likely to die from childbirth than white women. Racism is a public health issue and we must get serious about tackling the systemic racism in our institutions.
Cities refuse to build homeless shelters because they believe they’re a burden or unsightly. Our current housing system sets people up to fail and then refuses to help them once they do. This is not how we take care of our most vulnerable Americans. https://t.co/EjycQD6yO7
Last year, we saw rampant voter suppression all across our country, specifically targeting communities of color. The House is fighting to protect and expand our sacred right to vote. https://t.co/EInpzGgdHe

As the only president in recent history to refuse to release his tax returns, it’s clear that Trump is hiding something. The Democratic House majority is going to find out what. https://t.co/BAU5CysCIg
Strengthening voting rights. Protecting abortion access. Raising the minimum wage.  Expanding background checks.  What do these have in common? They’re all bills House Democrats have passed that McConnell refuses to bring to the Senate floor. #LegislativeGraveyard
I worked on and believed wholeheartedly in Shirley Chisholm’s historic campaign for president in 1972. Quite frankly, I’m shocked to still hear in 2019 the question of whether a woman could be elected to the White House. https://t.co/CTcpDYcLdl
Trump’s absurd Fourth of July celebration yesterday was partisan propaganda, a waste of taxpayer money, and not reflective of our country’s values. https://t.co/LUudBbedDE
On this #FourthOfJuly I can’t help but think about all the immigrants being held in inhumane detention centers and subjected to verbal and physical abuse by CBP agents. These are not the values our country represents.
Happy 4th of July! On Independence Day, let's remember the work we still have to do to ensure freedom and equality for all.

I can’t believe this still needs to be said in 2019, but every woman deserves access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care — and that includes abortion.

For too many families — especially in communities of color — paying the bills and keeping the lights on has become a cruel and impossible choice. Instead of kicking millions off of basic programs, we should expand opportunities for assistance to people living in poverty.

Medicaid saves lives. In states that expanded Medicaid, less African-American babies died in infancy. Why does Trump want to rip it away? https://t.co/1ODPA2Wogs
On this day in 2014, the Supreme Court decided the landmark Hobby Lobby case and ruled that employers don’t have to provide employees birth control. Health care will never be a universal right unless we fight back against the constant attacks on women’s reproductive freedom.

There’s no mistaking it: this president is a threat to national security and we cannot let him drag us into a war with Iran. Since Day One, I’ve supported repealing the AUMF and putting power back in the hands of Congress to declare war.
Climate change is one of the single greatest threats to humanity. We need a leader in the White House who will prioritize tackling climate change and protecting our environment. @KamalaHarris is that leader.
“Racism is so universal in this country, so widespread and deep-seated, that it is invisible because it is so normal.” — Shirley Chisholm #DemDebate
Let’s speak an uncomfortable but honest truth with one another: racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and transphobia are real in this country. They are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it. @DemDebate
Trump’s inhumane immigration detention centers are a stain on this country’s history. Our next president will inherit this crisis and we need to make sure that’s someone ready and able to solve it. I know who my choice is. https://t.co/8jN9yhNoaH
It’s absurd that families are forced to choose between life-saving care and putting food on the table. That’s why @KamalaHarris proudly supports Medicare for All and why I proudly support her. #DemDebate
It’s rather simple: stagnant wages can’t keep up with our country’s rising housing costs and people are forced to live on the streets. @KamalaHarris has a plan to #RaiseTheWage.
No one should have to choose between paying their rent on time and putting food on the table. @KamalaHarris has a plan to tackle poverty. You in? #DemDebate

After she won her election for the House, Shirley Chisholm told her colleagues, “I have no intention of just sitting quietly and observing. I intend to focus on the nation’s problems.” Let's all heed her advice and speak out about the issues facing our nation.
The Hyde Amendment discriminates against low-income women of color seeking an abortion. It must be repealed. #BeBoldEndHyde https://t.co/C4D2kWJbZs
BREAKING: In a win for our country, the Supreme Court just blocked Trump from adding his discriminatory citizenship question to the U.S. census. From the start, we all knew this was just another way to vilify immigrants and intimidate people of color.  https://t.co/lBtnS9foN7
As long as Trump sits in the White House, he is a danger to our country. The No War with Iran Caucus will force Trump to seek Congressional approval before any taking any action against Iran.
The Democrats on the debate stage are right: we must avoid war with Iran at all costs. Trump’s erratic behavior is a risk to us all and he must come before Congress before taking any action against Iran.
As Trump so gracefully likes to say, “Wrong!” https://t.co/xzaOd86MYe
Between this administration’s heartless, reckless immigration policies and the never-ending circus in the White House, Americans have had enough of the chaos and cruelty. I'm calling on the Trump administration to shut down his inhumane immigration detention facilities.
This administration’s blatant foot-dragging is unbelievable. People are suffering and asking for their government’s help. The Trump administration needs to follow through and provide Puerto Rico with the aid it deserves.  https://t.co/MjgkOEBsrL
War with Iran would have a devastating impact on US national security and further destabilize the Middle East. I co-founded the No War with Iran Caucus to hold this president accountable and make it clear that he must seek Congressional approval for any use of force against Iran.

On this day in 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage all across the country. No one should be punished because of who they are or who they love, but even today the LGBTQ* community faces discrimination. That’s why Congress must pass the #EqualityAct!
The student debt crisis is robbing a generation of their future. That’s why I’m proud to be an original co-sponsor of the #CollegeForAll bill. No one should be punished for seeking higher education — it’s time to make college accessible for all.
It’s rather simple: stagnant wages can’t keep up with our country’s rising housing costs, and people are forced to live on the streets. Democrats have plans to finally #RaiseTheWage, but the GOP keeps voting to keep families in poverty.
Buying a home is one of the best ways to build wealth and pass on that wealth to future generations. But a policy known as redlining prevents people in predominantly Black neighborhoods from securing a mortgage loan to buy a house. That’s racism.  https://t.co/a1yWfWHj70
Last year we saw voting rights attacked across the country. Ever since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, there has been a surge of voter suppression, disproportionately targeting communities of color and low-income voters. We must #RestoreTheVRA.
Trump and his hawkish advisors must not lead us into another war in the Middle East. We’ve seen the damage and destruction that endless wars have caused, and we cannot go down that path again. Trump and his advisors must work to de-escalate tensions.  https://t.co/orpLLKJ7Qj

On this day in 1972, Title IX was signed into law. Ever since it was enacted, it has opened up opportunities for women in education and athletics. We cannot allow the Trump administration to roll back the clock and strip our schools of Title IX protections.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there would be no Democratic Party without African American women. https://t.co/2xjC9Wf2p9
No one who suffers from mental illness should feel the need to take their own life because of an unpaid insurance bill. Our current health care system is failing families. There is no other way to say it. We must pass Medicare for All — lives are at stake. https://t.co/hGor9EgmQt
Title X ensures that everyone, regardless of income, has access to basic care like birth control, cancer screenings, and HIV tests. We can’t let this administration get away with their dangerous attacks on women. https://t.co/RdA7fbS15h

This is a dangerous moment for our country. I don’t even want to imagine the damage Trump and his hawkish henchmen could cause if they recklessly drag us into a war with Iran. Congress must reassert our authority and prevent this worst case scenario. https://t.co/oSuTcCKbcG

With Trump pushing us toward the brink of war Congress must repeal the 2001 AUMF, which is just a blank check for endless war. I'm proud my amendment to sunset the AUMF passed in the House, but we have to keep up the pressure to prevent war with Iran. https://t.co/7Ip6fApktO

This is disgraceful. The Central Park Five were 5 African American &amp; Latino boys wrongfully convicted of assault in 1989. Trump even took out full-page newspaper ads calling for their execution. They deserve every apology for what they've been put through. https://t.co/KYj9vUkUSi

On #WorldRefugeeDay, we remember all those who risk their lives for the hope of a better life. I firmly believe that any refugee fleeing violence and persecution should always have a home in the United States. Period.
The Affordable Care Act has been narrowly upheld twice by the Supreme Court, and with Republicans threatening to fill another seat on the bench with a right-wing judge, it’s never been more important that we kick Trump and his henchmen out of office come 2020.
1 in 10 Americans are skipping doses because prescription drug prices are too high. A $50 inhaler now costs $1,000/month. This is the grim reality for far too many people. We must take action now to hold Big Pharma accountable for their hurtful practices.  https://t.co/XYdJxsNbar
Slavery will forever be a stain on our country’s history. That’s why I’m proud to support #HR40 and reparations for Black Americans who have been and continue to be disproportionately wronged by our country’s policies. #Juneteenth
This is not a drill: Trump is plotting to dismantle the ACA and strip health care coverage from millions of Americans. I won’t let us return to the dark days where insurance companies wrote the rules &amp; refused to cover people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/sSM4lhTAek
BREAKING: The House just passed my amendment to sunset the AUMF that gives presidents blank checks for endless war. As Trump continues to escalate dangerous tensions with Iran, Congress must reassert our authority before he leads us down a path we regret.
Today, the Poor People’s Campaign testified before Congress about their Moral Budget. Their argument? Everyone has the right to live. With 140 million people living in poverty, we need a budget that places people over corporations and fights to end poverty once and for all.
Let’s not sugarcoat it: racism is alive and well in America. But I’m fighting as hard as I can to expel it from our systems and bring about true emancipation for every person of color. Happy #Juneteenth!
When Black Americans are suppressed from voting, that’s not freedom.   When Black people are locked out of job opportunities, when Black unemployment is almost twice the national average, when Black students are denied equal education opportunities, that’s not freedom.
When Black mothers are 3-4x more likely to die from childbirth than white women, that’s not freedom.  When Black boys are increasingly and disproportionately murdered in police shootings, when Black men are more likely to be locked away for petty crimes, that’s not freedom.
And while today is a celebration, it’s also a reminder of how deep racism runs and how much farther we have to go to achieve true freedom.
On #Juneteenth, we remember that on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers marched to Galveston, TX, with news that slavery was abolished. More than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, around 250,000 enslaved people were finally freed.
We have seen the destruction blank checks for endless war have caused in the past. Congress cannot allow this president to use unverified information to incite war with Iran. Trump must come before Congress and make his case before any action is taken. https://t.co/XVzYzSCv8C
Shirley Chisholm inspired countless women of color — including me — to get involved in politics and fight for what we believe in. We honor her legacy by continuing to fight for seats at the table. And if they won’t make room, we’ll bring folding chairs. https://t.co/zIBAdhrRaw
Here’s the bottom line: Trump’s escalating trade war with China is threatening to hurt American people, American businesses, and to derail our economy. Trump said he was “for”  working people and now he’s playing games with their livelihoods. Shameful.

People live in cars and on the streets because of soaring housing costs. Students work 2-3 jobs just to pay rent. Teachers drive hours to schools because they can no longer afford to live in East Bay. My Renters Bill of Rights will finally tackle the housing crisis head-on.
The Affordable Care Act saves lives, including millions of African Americans who now have better access to cancer screenings and treatment. The GOP wants to rip this away.  https://t.co/Rg6BZW7e3J
Nearly half of all older Americans would be living below the poverty line without Social Security. It’s critical that we fight to protect Social Security for our nation’s current and future seniors.
Our immigrant facilities are not safe under the Trump’s reign. LGBTQ migrants are 97% more likely to be sexually assaulted when compared to other detainees. That’s unacceptable.
No one is above the law, not even the president. The House must begin an inquiry into impeachment. https://t.co/9TNe2ND9vh
Our coral reefs, once astonishingly beautiful with vibrant colors, are turning gray. Species are disappearing. By the year 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. On #WorldOceansDay, we must commit to preserve and protect this vital part of our ecosystem.
Trump’s #CubaTravelBan will harm Cubans and Americans alike. We cannot let Trump take us back to 60 years of failed embargo policy. https://t.co/W8eXIKbRZP

The #HydeAmendment discriminates against low-income women and women of color. All Democrats must stand united on repealing this outdated law that restricts women’s access to comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion.  https://t.co/syrclZReFl
The Trump administration’s corrupt behavior surrounding the Mueller report has been startling to say the least. I believe it’s time the House open an inquiry into impeachment proceedings now.
Make no mistake: Trump needs Congressional approval to go to war with Iran, and he absolutely does not have it. #StopEndlessWars https://t.co/KRYvQ42S6q
On National Gun Violence Awareness Day we wear orange to remind everyone that our nation’s gun violence epidemic is completely unnecessary. We have the solutions to end this crisis, but Republican lawmakers would rather receive big checks from the NRA than protect American lives.
Undocumented young people and their families are every bit American as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. It’s shameful he’s refusing to bring the American Dream and Promise Act to a vote in the Senate. #DreamAndPromiseNOW https://t.co/ktdDe2gSgq
A reminder that the House passed disaster relief nine months late because the Republican Party refused to give up their quest for a useless border wall. Happy to see this relief finally go toward families hit by natural disasters but outraged at the Republican stonewalling.
Trump is doing everything in his power to deprive migrant children of a future in America, including denying them English classes, legal assistance, and recreation. Just when you think his xenophobic agenda couldn’t get any more cruel, he outdoes himself.  https://t.co/cGaNPiHk8w
On the 75th anniversary of #DDay, we remember and honor our brave veterans who fought on the beaches of Normandy during WWII — including my father, Lt. Col. Garvin A. Tutt. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.

Less than one percent of the cannabis industry is owned by people of color but people of color are four times more likely to be arrested for possession. Marijuana has long been a driving force in our country for mass incarceration. It's time we end our nation’s outdated laws.
Everyone has the right to a roof over their head. Period. That’s why I’m introducing a Housing Bill of Rights to address our nation’s housing crisis and provide quality, affordable housing all across our country. It’s time we make housing a national priority.

Today is #WorldEnvironmentDay and a great time to recommit ourselves to tackling climate change. Climate change is a rapidly escalating threat to all of us — it’s time we take it seriously, act accordingly to create a clean energy future, and stop the worst possible impacts.
Deeply saddened by the passing of Johana Medina Leon, a transgender woman recently released from ICE. Her story is not unique — the Trump administration has created severe conditions for transgender migrants that threaten their health and safety. https://t.co/WRdLKZm5LP
Big news! Yesterday, the House passed the historic American Dream and Promise Act to provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of dreamers. While Trump’s xenophobic agenda does everything it can to strip immigrant rights, Democrats will always be there to fight back.
To those celebrating the end of Ramadan, I wish you all a happy and peaceful Eid al-Fitr! May your time be spent with family and good food. #EidMubarak
The numbers don’t lie: a majority of Americans do NOT support the GOP’s strict ban on abortions. Once again, Republicans must answer to the American people for their horrendous policies.  https://t.co/FnJI86Uppx
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Congress passing the #19thAmendment, we honor the suffragettes who fought so hard for a woman’s right to vote. But the truth is many women of color are still disenfranchised even today and we must not give up the fight for true equality.
Every day a new report warns how serious climate change is. Still, the Trump administration is full of climate deniers pushing their anti-environment agenda. There is no other way to say it: our planet is dying and we will suffer unless we act now. https://t.co/r7vzTrNt1f
After months of delay caused by Republicans, the House finally passed a $19.1 billion disaster relief bill for communities across the country that desperately need help. I’m fed up with the GOP’s unbelievable stonewalling.
We must end this president’s stranglehold on power. He is leading our country down a path of financial insecurity and bulldozing through American families in his way.  https://t.co/RySESI7RNs
As we celebrate #PrideMonth, we cannot forget that LGBTQ people of color disproportionately face hatred, discrimination, and violence across the country. In 2018, there were 26 transgender women killed in the U.S., nearly all of whom were black women. We must not forget them.
We are running out of time to save our planet — and President Trump is speeding up the clock with policies that drastically exacerbate climate change.  https://t.co/BeosHJfjlE
Universal childcare is an absolute necessity for working moms across the country struggling to put food on the table. If we want to finally close the gender pay gap, we need accessible, affordable childcare programs.

Very proud of the positive race that @realkimberlye ran. As an African American woman and a progressive democrat, I was honored to support you and your brilliant leadership.
It’s crystal clear: the Republican agenda is racist and xenophobic. Trump’s citizenship question is nothing more than hateful discrimination seeking to intimidate people of color. We must not allow our country to stand for this racist behavior.  https://t.co/scXofrdmjf
Racism, homophobia, transphobia, and stigma often prevent people with HIV from seeking treatment. If the Trump administration is serious about ending the HIV epidemic, it must end its crusade against the LGBTQ community and communities of color.

Nearly one million Californians don’t have access to clean water. That’s unacceptable. It’s 2019 — we should be able to guarantee clean water for every single person across this state.
The jobs of the future are in tech — but African Americans are largely locked out of this industry. We must tackle big tech’s diversity issue head-on and ensure everyone has a seat at the table.

After years of GOP cuts, our 2020 Labor-HHS-Education Bill will finally make critical investments in poverty reduction, public health, medical research, education, &amp; labor programs that will train the workers of the future. Democrats are committed to fighting #ForThePeople 💪🏿
Your daily reminder that the GOP is so deep in the pockets of a few mega-wealthy special interests, they have to block people from voting to win elections.  https://t.co/RQ6PKAa1ym
We can’t ignore race. Our country's racist policies have created generational damage that affect people of color every single day. If we want a better, brighter future, we must acknowledge the role racism plays in our systems and work to correct those wrongs.
As members of Congress, it is our constitutional duty to put country over party and serve the people. Despite this administration’s blatant roadblocking, the House will fight to uncover the truth. https://t.co/l1gecLASbn
My heart is with all those affected by this horrible act of gun violence. Our children deserve better.  https://t.co/RNA9vMMlID
What can I say? 💃🏿 https://t.co/OIYCHRDXma
This has absolutely nothing to do with moral values and everything to do with attacking women. It’s dangerous, appalling, and will be fought.  https://t.co/5ZNgqmHh56
Outrageous out-of-pocket costs prevent people from life-saving HIV prevention and treatment programs. We need to pass #MedicareForAll so every member of the LGBTQ community has access to the care they deserve.
Thoughts and prayers are a beautiful thing, but to protect our children and our communities, we need real, commonsense gun reform. And that’s exactly what House Democrats plan to do.  https://t.co/1aLALQV1OI
Teachers are heroes. They make an immeasurable difference in our children's lives and shape the next generation of leaders. Teachers deserve our respect, gratitude, and most importantly, a raise. #TeacherAppreciationDay
Trump can threaten us however he wants — Congress has the constitutional authority to conduct oversight over this administration’s corrupt behavior. https://t.co/dtLjsIdya2
The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first law that banned an entire specific ethnic group from immigrating to the US. Centuries later, our current president has tried multiple times to implement an abhorrent Muslim ban. We must learn from history's mistakes. https://t.co/L8zB5CQjZX
Trump manufactured a crisis at our border. Now he, once again, wants taxpayer money to fund his cruel immigration policies like protecting ICE and expanding family detention. This is ridiculous.  https://t.co/DM0eN8Eigp
One million species face extinction because of humans. That’s 1/8 of our entire planet. We can no longer wait to tackle climate change — our world is dying before our eyes and we must act now before it’s too late.  https://t.co/6acq3bMJCM
These children never should have been separated from their families in the first place. Trump’s immoral immigration policies are a complete disgrace to our country.  https://t.co/KHv8jPTl6n
#RamadanMubarak to everyone celebrating this month! I wish you and your family a joyful, peaceful, and reflective #Ramadan.
Let’s not forget that thousands of communities across America still have lead in their water. It’s 2019 — we should be able to guarantee clean water for everyone.
It's no secret that American infrastructure is falling apart. Decades of under-investment has severely limited the full potential of our economy. It’s about time we invest the funds needed to revitalize our nation’s infrastructure.  https://t.co/FOnaOuszLg
Americans spend more on pharmaceutical drugs than anyone else in the world. In one of the wealthiest nations, it’s outrageous that anyone ever has to choose between life-saving medicine and putting food on the table.
With hate crimes on the rise in America, everyone — on both sides of the aisle — must speak out against this race-baiting, hateful rhetoric. End of story. https://t.co/r1QyCjE3hN
There is not a single place in the U.S. where the minimum wage can cover basic living expenses. It’s past time to #RaiseTheWage and give American workers a fighting chance.
Climate change is the defining issue of our time. Democrats are choosing to fight for future generations and take necessary action to save our planet.  https://t.co/fo1kYYXavV
Nearly one third of parents cannot afford regular baby diapers. My #EndDiaperNeed Act would create a $100 million fund for distributing free diapers to low-income families.
58 years ago, the first Freedom Riders, including @repjohnlewis, endured violence and attacks as they rode integrated buses into segregated neighborhoods. Now, it’s on us to continue their fight for equality, justice, and civil rights. https://t.co/3aSP3m0Okk
Teachers shape our children’s lives and we can’t even provide them with a living salary or affordable housing. It’s appalling. https://t.co/vmx6j2dMbI

It's 2019. Abstinence-only education is ineffective and a complete disservice to our young people. #SexEdForAll https://t.co/TRKO8QYxoY
Trump just got one step closer to dismantling the *entire* Affordable Care Act. We won’t let his administration get away with stripping life-saving health care from millions of Americans. Democrats will always fight to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/JROjt3vTIe
In a time when the President of the United States routinely attacks the press, it’s more important than ever that we unite together to protect this vital institution. On #WorldPressFreedomDay, I thank all the journalists who continue to stand up to Trump and his administration.
Let’s be clear: Trump’s new rule is a dangerous threat to the health of every American and a direct attack on women, women of color, and LGBTQ people. Personal beliefs should never dictate patient care. https://t.co/INavZOSwJM
During #AAPI Heritage Month, we recognize all the contributions Asian Pacific Americans have made to our nation’s civic, economic, and cultural development. The East Bay’s diversity is its greatest strength &amp; I'm proud to represent such a vibrant Asian Pacific American community.
We must legalize marijuana, yes. But more importantly, we must ensure that people of color have a seat at the table and those who have been hurt by the failed #WarOnDrugs receive the justice they deserve.  https://t.co/OL7fPxlt5X
Voting is a right. Seeking asylum is a right. Reproductive health is a right.  Don’t let the Republican Party convince you otherwise.

Millions of children across the country depend on Medicaid. We should be doing everything we can to protect this vital program from the GOP’s attempts to dismantle it.
It’s clear: families are suffering at the hands of Big Pharma. According to recent reports, Big Pharma has lied to the FDA, skyrocketed drug prices 97,000%, and bribed doctors to increase sales. It's outrageous and I’m fighting to end this corruption.  https://t.co/8uJXtAyLyz
After Democratic Senators grilled AG Barr over his mishandling of the Mueller report, he has refused to attend the House hearing today. Barr has lied to the American people and is unfit to serve as Attorney General. He must resign now.
The number of people experiencing homelessness is increasing across the country, especially in California. It’s an absolute disgrace that people are forced to choose between medicine, rent, and food.   Affordable housing is a basic human right.
It’s despicable that Iowa Republicans have banned Medicare funding for transgender surgery. Trans people have the right to exist as their authentic selves free from discrimination.  https://t.co/mVP4xUS6iB
How much longer will our nation wait to act on gun violence? My heart goes out to the #UNCC community as they suffer through this tragedy.   https://t.co/kFsnGAcnLP
Mueller has stated that AG Barr’s summary of his report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions.”   It’s clear AG Barr has more allegiance to Trump than the American people. He must resign now.
On #MayDay, we’re reminded that working Americans still don’t make a living wage while giant corporations rake in the profits. Today, and everyday, we must recognize how important unions are to representing and fighting for everyday Americans. https://t.co/yEG03yxQAF
Trump needs to read a copy of the Constitution. Congress has the legal right to investigate the president. And, trust me, we have a long list of wrongdoings to get through. https://t.co/5YrwYDGBmG
The Justice Department is a separate entity of the White House, yet Barr acts more like Trump’s personal defense lawyer rather than our country’s attorney general. Attorney General Barr must resign for his mishandling of the Mueller report. https://t.co/D5xYFIoG2r
The rates of suicide for African American children ages 5-12 have exceeded those of white children for the first time. The Emergency Taskforce on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health will work to solve this crisis &amp; provide our Black youth with essential mental health care.
More people are arrested for marijuana than for all violent crimes combined. The criminalization of marijuana has long been a driving force for mass incarceration in this country and I’m fighting to end it.
Our current health care system is expensive and frustrating for too many families. We won’t stop fighting until health care is a fundamental right for everyone — not just the wealthy.
Let’s be clear: Trump’s gross lies about abortion are a direct attack on women and must be condemned. This is nothing more than an attempt to spread dangerous falsehoods and I won’t stand for it. https://t.co/Ff3PgEndPH
Racism is a public health issue. African American women are 4x more likely to die from childbirth than white women and African American men are dying from police brutality at alarming rates. We must acknowledge and fight institutionalized racism before any more lives are lost.
Too many Americans are being forced to choose between life-saving prescription drugs and putting food on the table. Our pharmaceutical industry is outrageous. https://t.co/tX4Imk0X57
Education is one of the most effective ways to end recidivism. The #REALAct would provide a path for incarcerated students to successfully re-enter society by allowing them to use Pell Grants for higher education. Real solutions for real reforms.

As some of our nation’s most effective anti-poverty programs, Social Security and Medicare are lifelines for our seniors. I will always fight against Republican attempts to dismantle these vital retirement programs.
861,000 children no longer receive Medicaid because the Trump administration’s policies have cut enrollment programs, changed eligibility requirements, and threatened to penalize legal immigrants for using these public benefits. It’s shameful. https://t.co/ckU2le7gZM

One in three people is directly affected by the opioid epidemic. And a majority of Americans believe the government should take action to reduce the devastating effects of opioid abuse. We must start treating this like the public health crisis it is.
African American women are the most educated demographic in America, but they also suffer the most from student loans. Fixing the student debt crisis IS racial justice.  https://t.co/o0KGnVmrng

From 1961-1971, the U.S. military sprayed Agent Orange over Vietnam, causing generations of Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans to suffer even today. I introduced the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 to provide vital services for those exposed to this toxic chemical.

Title X ensures that everyone, regardless of income, has access to basic care like birth control, cancer screenings, and HIV tests. Trump’s Title X gag rule would strip this essential care from millions. I’m fighting to end this administration’s dangerous attacks on women.

Students of color are more likely to be disciplined, suspended, and drop out. These discriminatory policies set students up to fail and push them toward the juvenile justice system. We must end the school to prison pipeline and give our young people of color a fair shot at life.

On #420, millions will gather to celebrate marijuana. But for many, it’s just another painful reminder of our nation’s discriminatory practices. My Marijuana Justice Act would reform our outdated marijuana laws while providing restorative justice to communities of color.

Let’s make one thing clear: asylum is a right. Many immigrants risk their lives to flee violence, sexual assault, and extreme poverty. They place hope in our nation to provide shelter and protection. We must live up to our values and offer assistance.

Even with Barr’s ridiculous redactions of the Mueller report, it’s clear Trump took actions that could be considered obstruction of justice. Attorney General Barr must release the full, unredacted report immediately so Congress &amp; the American people can make their own decisions.

Racism is a public health issue. African American women are 3-4 times more likely to die from childbirth complications than white women. That’s unacceptable. During Black Maternal Health Week, we must recommit ourselves to providing support for Black mamas. #BlackMamasMatter
On this day in 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. sat in jail and wrote a letter to the world known as the Letter from Birmingham Jail. He reminded us that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Read his words here: https://t.co/sREgpdnd52
Affordable Housing, quality health care, and a living wage are fundamental human rights. No ifs, ands, or buts.

#TaxDay seems like a great day for Trump to release his tax returns and give the American people the transparency they deserve.
The data is clear: poverty can have a lasting impact on a wide range of psychological issues. Congress must step up and do their jobs to #EndPoverty now. https://t.co/UkZfD3DrQ7
On #TaxDay many Americans will owe the government money instead of getting their usual refund. That's because Republicans gave massive cuts to the wealthy &amp; left everyone else in the dust. Now to pay for the #GOPTaxScam, Trump wants to cut programs like Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Wow.
Always remember: there would be no Democratic Party without African American women.
Americans owe $1.5 trillion in student debt. That’s unacceptable. It’s past time we take serious action to address this crisis and provide our students with the relief they desperately need.
Even as Trump continues to undermine protections and destroy our environment, California is leading the way to protect and expand clean water.  https://t.co/SFrC4IIOzl
65% of the homeless population in Berkeley is African American, despite being only 10% of the general population. We need to address the racial disparities &amp; focus efforts to address the homelessness crisis — which means significant investments to end homelessness at all levels.

As climate change worsens — causing draughts, rising sea levels, and violent storms — women and girls will bear the brunt of this global crisis. My Women and Climate Change Act would tackle this issue while uplifting, including, and empowering women everywhere.
There’s no playing nice: the cannabis industry must include communities of color at every level. We should also pass the #MarijuanaJusticeAct now to legalize cannabis and provide restorative justice for those devastated by the failed #WarOnDrugs.
Don’t let the GOP fool you — the Trump tax cut was always designed to benefit the rich at the expense of everyday families.
Over half of people ages 13-24 who are living with HIV don’t know it. Fear and stigma often prevent us from having necessary conversations about HIV. But these young people are trying to change that: https://t.co/jjyTPfAg5V
The GOP wants to force “able-bodied” people to work for SNAP benefits. But many recipients often have undiagnosed illnesses or physical disabilities that make it hard to hold a job. It’s wrong to dangle this program in front of those who desperately need it. #HandsOffSNAP
Trump’s shameful #TransMilitaryBan goes into effect today. It’s outrageous that Republicans have allowed another discriminatory policy to hold the LGBTQ community captive. Transgender service members have served our country with honor — they deserve our respect and support.
Education empowers people to take control of their lives. The #REALAct would allow incarcerated students to use Pell Grants for higher education, providing a path for successful reentry into society.
Enacted 50 years ago today, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 was landmark legislation that guaranteed equal housing opportunities regardless of race. But even today, we must expand affordable housing programs to ensure that communities of color have a solid roof over their heads.

Hate crimes are on the rise in America. From white supremacist attacks to hateful fear-mongering rhetoric, we cannot tolerate such disgusting behavior. We must unite together to #EndHate.

Today, I joined @RepAdams &amp; @LaurenUnderwood to launch the Black Maternal Health Caucus. It’s outrageous that African-American women are 3-4 times more likely to die from childbirth than white women. It’s past time we address it. #BlackMamasMatter
The humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico is absolutely heartbreaking. But Trump continually refuses to give Puerto Rico the resources it needs, leading to run-down medical facilities and wide-spread hunger. Puerto Ricans deserve our compassion and support. https://t.co/3nQekHwsE8
Once again, I urge President Trump to listen to Congress and uphold the War Powers Resolution to end our nation’s involvement in the deadly war in Yemen. No more blank checks for #EndlessWar.

Reasons why we should invest in public transit:  1️⃣ Stimulates our economy 2️⃣ Helps lower-income communities get to employment opportunities  3️⃣ Supports the elderly, people with disabilities, &amp; those who can't drive 4️⃣ Benefits our environment 5️⃣ Connects our communities
No one should have to drive hours for necessary medication. Health care is a right and must be accessible for everyone, including members of the transgender community. https://t.co/i3hmIObQ3u
Kirstjen Nielsen should have resigned a long time ago. Her support of the Trump administration’s cruel immigration policies is truly indefensible. Families have been separated. People have died. Children have been traumatized. I’m glad she’s leaving.
Our criminal justice system is deeply flawed. It’s one in which for-profit prisons depend on mass incarceration to churn a profit. It’s discriminatory and wrong and must end now.
I said it before and I’ll say it again: African American women will help us regain the soul of this country. https://t.co/j3w0z4IfTn
Winning the war on poverty is going to take work. A lot of work. We must revamp our education system, invest in public assistance, extend public transit, raise the minimum wage — and above all, we must level the playing field so everyone can succeed. But this fight is worth it.

Everyone has the right to a roof over their head. But Trump is threatening to cut $10 billion from vital affordable housing programs. We must expand programs that keep Americans on their feet, not rip assistance out from under them.
It’s clear: the #GOPTaxScam deepened the pockets of the 1%, leaving everyday Americans to foot the bill. Wish I could say I’m surprised.  https://t.co/IatsWkRBGD
The American people deserve truth, transparency, and accountability. Every presidential candidate since Nixon has released their tax returns. If Trump is so unwilling to release his own, it begs the question: what is he trying to hide?
When the GOP tries to dismantle our health care, take away the right to vote, or make it harder for students to pay off loans, who is always there fighting back? African American women. African American women will help us regain the soul of America.
The price of insulin has risen so much that one in four people with diabetes are skipping life-saving doses. Let that sink in. Our pharmaceutical industry is so corrupt that instead of saving lives, they skyrocket the price of drugs and profit off the backs of everyday people.
.@AOC is right, we have an expiration date when it comes to climate change. The @UN’s newest report gives us 12 years to turn things around before environmental catastrophe. We need to take climate change seriously. Now.   https://t.co/M3BM11wA1d
Our federal marijuana laws are discriminatory and outdated. The bipartisan #STATESAct would prevent the federal government from interfering in states where marijuana is legal. Forty-six states have legalized some form of cannabis — it’s time the federal government caught up.
There is no reason convicted domestic abusers should own a gun. Proud of my colleagues who stood up to the gun lobby and voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. https://t.co/FNW4B6Ivxl
Access to quality education, quality health care, and quality housing should never depend on how deep your pockets are. Period.
“It’s going to have a negative impact on the economy...but to me, security is what’s most important.”  Translation: “I’m going to hurt families with my reckless policies...but to me, shoring up my base while vilifying immigrants is what’s most important.” https://t.co/pVFcgvUcuy
Hundreds of thousands rely on SNAP every day to feed their families. This fight is personal: as a single mother raising two sons, I depended on food stamps too. We cannot let Trump rip away this lifeline for American families. https://t.co/ZODOi7YEIz
In our current health care system, African American women are 3-4 times more likely to die from childbirth than white women. It’s shameful, wrong, and must be addressed before any more mothers die from avoidable causes.
Today is truly historic. For the first time in history, a war powers resolution will head to the president's desk. Congress — not the president — has the power to declare war. It's time we end our nation's complicity in the deadly war in Yemen.
“Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”  On the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, we honor his legacy and continue his work by always striving for equality, justice, and peace. https://t.co/NbVR6rWhq9
In the richest nation on Earth, it’s deeply discouraging that 40% of Americans don’t have the funds to cover a $400 emergency. We need policies that lift everyday families up, not deepen the pockets of the 1%.

Trump continues to undermine and sabotage our health care system every day — especially for communities of color. The Congressional Black Caucus is fighting to protect and expand quality care to those who would be disproportionately affected. https://t.co/Yysq8YKxtt
Let me make myself clear: people are not illegal. Trump’s immigration policies have nothing to do with security and everything to do with persecuting immigrants. Closing the Southern Border would worsen the humanitarian crisis and cost our country billions of dollars. https://t.co/H9mBZcvfem
Congrats to @LightfootForChi on becoming Chicago's first African American woman and openly LGBTQ mayor! I know Lori will be the strong progressive leader Chicago deserves. And I can't wait to see everything the city accomplishes under her leadership.
The NRA has made the Violence Against Women Act its new target because it would keep guns out of the hands of abusers. Let me make myself clear: anyone who sides with the gun lobby instead of fighting to protect women stands on the wrong side of history.
Our nation’s greatest strength is diversity and our history has been immeasurably enriched by our Caribbean neighbors. The United States must support the people of Haiti as they continue their fight for democracy, justice, and civil rights.  https://t.co/qSCGdxouvq

Today — 91 days into 2019 — is #EqualPayDay, when women’s wages catch up to what men were paid last year. Women still only earn 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. The wage gap is even worse for women of color. It’s past time this country delivers on its promise of equality.
America’s children depend on Medicaid. And now Trump wants them to foot the bill for his #GOPTaxScam by making massive cuts to this vital program. Not on my watch. https://t.co/J3dgAy0kpR

Preventative care can be life-saving — but far too many people can’t afford routine check-ups and uncover life-threatening illnesses too late for treatment. During #NationalPublicHealthWeek, we must recommit ourselves to ensuring everyone has access to quality health care.

Pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement was a huge step backward for our health, environment, and economy. The Climate Action Now Act would reverse Trump’s decision to withdraw from this vitally important agreement and forbid him from doing it again.

Trump wants $8.6 billion for an ineffective border wall in his 2020 budget. Here are some better uses of those taxpayer dollars: ✅ Revitalizing our nation’s infrastructure ✅ Investing in quality education for our children ✅ Medicare for All ✅ Address affordable housing
In order to help struggling Americans, Congress needs to invest in anti-poverty programs, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — not threaten to take them away.
Quality education should not be a function of where you live. Our economy depends on rural communities and workers — and we need to invest in them.  https://t.co/iw0J8d9nMQ
Two things: 1. Abortion access is health care.  2. Reproductive rights are human rights.
Women make up a quarter of all people with HIV — the risks are even higher for women of color and transgender women. It's time we change that. On National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, we must recommit ourselves to ending the HIV epidemic for women and girls everywhere.
We all have a fundamental right to quality health care, good public education, a living wage, and affordable housing. They should never depend on where you live or how deep your pockets are.

162 years ago, the Supreme Court issued the landmark Dred Scott decision that ruled slaves as property and not U.S. citizens. More than a century later we’ve made a lot of progress, but we still have a long way to go to ensure true equality for all Americans.
A free and open internet is the single most important free speech tool we have, and without it, our democracy is in real danger. We must restore #NetNeutrality by passing the Save the Internet Act now.
People of color and those in the LGBTQ community do not receive the same HIV prevention efforts as other white, heterosexual communities. We must tackle discriminatory forces — including racism and homophobia — if we want to finally end the HIV epidemic. https://t.co/31UFKJ26ZT
Student debt is holding an entire generation hostage. That's why we introduced our #DebtFreeCollegeAct — because no one should be punished with crushing debt for seeking higher education.
Our elections have been co-opted by special interests for far too long. The #ForThePeople Act would end the reign of shady billionaires, give power back to the people, and restore our democracy.
Immigrants make the harrowing journey to the US, often arriving seriously injured or sick. Under the Trump administration's immigration policies, CBP doesn’t have the resources to treat them, which has led to multiple deaths. I’m demanding reforms now. https://t.co/QkIVneTfNj

U.S.-based marijuana companies are going overseas to conduct research because of our strict federal marijuana laws. My Marijuana Justice Act would legalize marijuana at the federal level and provide a path for our nation to become innovators in the expanding cannabis industry.

3️⃣ Did you know that less than one percent of the cannabis industry is owned or operated by people of color? My RESPECT Resolution would encourage policy reforms to help communities of color take part in the promising cannabis industry.
2️⃣ The REFER Act would ban the use of federal funding by any agency to interfere in state and local cannabis laws.
1️⃣ The Marijuana Justice Act would reform our unjust marijuana laws and provide restorative justice to communities of color. Enough with the failed war on drugs.
Today, I introduced three bills aimed at ending discrimination in the marijuana industry. For too long, underrepresented communities have been left out of the discussion. It's time we end our nation’s outdated marijuana laws and bring about true criminal justice reform. ⤵️
Families feel the sting as prescription drug costs continue to skyrocket. And let’s not forget how Republicans turned a blind eye to give tax breaks to Big Pharma. It's outrageous.

A $15 wage means workers can sleep more and have less medical issues; women can afford birth control and teen pregnancy rates decrease; families don't have to live in fear that a traffic ticket prevents them from affording dinner that night. Raising the minimum wage saves lives.
Today I’m voting to block the #FakeTrumpEmergency from stealing from military families to fund Trump’s ridiculous border wall. I’m calling on my colleagues in Congress to do the same.
After years of Republican inaction, the House is ready to: ✅ Stand up to the NRA ✅ Expand universal background checks ✅ #EndGunViolence

Opioid abuse is growing and it’s now more likely to die from an overdose than in a car crash. This administration has failed to treat this epidemic as the public health crisis it is. We must invest more resources in prevention and addiction treatment now.

From the medical industry to the arts, and everything in between, #BlackHistoryBuiltThis country. The contributions made by African Americans should not only be celebrated this month, but every month — because Black history is American history. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/uXVY1c12qt
National Parks were established to protect and safeguard our precious environment. The #TrumpShutdown has walked all over them — literally.  https://t.co/R1G3mPAH6W
Maya Angelou overcame many obstacles to become a writer and civil rights leader. Her famous words still ring true today — no matter what, we will rise and fight for truth, justice, and equality. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/KH1z4w4oIN
Rising sea levels can lead to severe flooding, loss of crucial habitats, and devastating coastal erosion. The world is changing before our eyes and we can’t ignore it. Our future depends on us taking the threat of climate change seriously.  https://t.co/StDeXJKJzn
If the pro-life movement was really about family values, the GOP would also support paid child leave, social services like Medicaid, ending maternity deaths — and they sure wouldn’t stand for ripping families apart at the border. Hypocrisy at its finest.
“You don’t make progress by standing on the sidelines.” — Shirley Chisholm  https://t.co/uU9bwneogU
Last year, we saw voting rights attacked across the country. Now, Mitch McConnell is calling making Election Day a federal holiday a “power grab.” It’s imperative that we strengthen every American’s right to vote — and that starts with a federal holiday.
Many of our federal workers chose a life of government service because they desired to serve their country. Now, they’re wondering if it’s even worth it. The Republican Party let them down — but we’re doing everything in our power to make sure it never happens again.
The world needs fewer nuclear weapons — not more. Pulling out of the #INFTreaty is another in the long list of reckless decisions made by the Trump Administration that puts our world at risk.  https://t.co/Q0D4DhPKXx
Republicans are intent on sabotaging our health care system every chance they get. But no matter how many times they try to strip life-saving care away from families, I promise you this: I will never stop fighting for your right to health care.
Our children and grandchildren are counting on us to make the world a better place for them. That means we must invest in Medicare for All, take climate change seriously, eliminate crushing student debt, and ensure that they have the tools to succeed in a technology-driven era.
The #GOPTaxScam gave massive tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations. The deficit went up. Now the government needs to borrow $1 trillion to compensate. Outrageous — and completely avoidable.  https://t.co/W2OWgOXykd
Why so scared? 🤔🤔🤔 https://t.co/dPaI581QNK
Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are still walking on eggshells in fear that Trump will shut down the government again unless he gets his border wall. We must keep fighting against Trump’s dangerous policies — American families can’t take another painful shutdown.
Shirley was the first African American to serve in Congress, the first Democratic woman candidate for president, and the first to inspire me to run for office. Her strength in the face of adversity has left a lasting impact on me — one I’ll never forget. https://t.co/bjE8IRcuY0

Essential programs like Social Security help keep millions of Americans on their feet. While the GOP tries to rip them away, Democrats are fighting to protect — and expand — these programs.
We must lift and amplify the voices of sexual assault survivors — not silence and shame them. Secretary DeVos’ new proposals are a sham and should not be implemented on our campuses. https://t.co/KNPZxw9fVl
The #PaycheckFairness Act would work to finally close the discriminatory gender pay gap. No longer should women, especially women of color, be forced to work for less than they deserve.

The bitterly cold temperatures this week are threatening some of our most vulnerable populations, like the homeless. It shouldn’t take a winter storm for us to address this problem — housing is a human right. We need to increase federal funding for affordable housing programs.

Since the House was sworn in we’ve: ✅ Ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history ✅ Introduced legislation to expand background checks  ✅ Announced the #RaiseTheWage Act to help working families  ✅ Spent every day fighting back against the GOP's reckless policies
10 years ago, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law, helping to ensure that all Americans are paid equally and fairly. But women, especially women of color, are still paid less than their male counterparts. We must keep fighting for equality in the workplace.
Over a million federal contractors aren’t guaranteed a paycheck for the 35 days the government was shut down. All the while, Trump is threatening yet another shutdown. It’s downright cruel to those who have already suffered so much. https://t.co/Grdqnm6VMG
While I’m happy that our national parks finally have the resources to get back up and running, the damage caused from Trump’s shutdown is absolutely devastating. It's outrageous he's threatening to shut down our government again. https://t.co/eETDo3oYfp
Thoughts and prayers don’t mean anything without action. The House stands ready to act. https://t.co/awYfGSUrPk
I support Medicare for All because access to preventative or life-saving health care should never depend on how deep your pockets are.
Hundreds of thousands of people will finally head back to work today, but don’t be fooled: Trump is threatening another shutdown if he doesn’t get funding for his border wall. The American people must not be bargaining chips in the GOP’s latest partisan game.

The past four years have been the hottest years on record. It’s not a fluke, it’s not bad luck — it’s climate change. We must address this crisis now before it’s too late.

African American women are three to four times more likely to die from childbirth than white women. It’s shameful, wrong, and must be addressed before any more mothers die from avoidable causes.

Tomorrow a new era begins. With a new majority in the House, we can finally get to work for the people, not corporations or wealthy donors. Our first order of business? End the #TrumpShutdown.
Day 12 of the Trump Shutdown and the president is refusing to budge on his outrageous demands for his border wall. It’s time for the president to get over his temper tantrum and work for the American people, instead of hurting them.
Happy New Year! Hope 2019 brings you and your family peace, love, and happiness. https://t.co/TACsoyD9xF
As 2018 ends, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your support of our campaign, our historic wave of Democratic victories &amp; our progressive movement.  As I look ahead to the new year, I am excited that we will continue to work together for progress, peace &amp; justice.

One year ago today, Trump signed his trillion dollar tax scam into law to benefit his rich donors and corporations at the expense of working-class Americans.  https://t.co/N6VxJMPNYd
Trump threatened yesterday that the government shutdown will “last for a very long time.” It’s time for Republicans in Congress to stop letting Trump hold the government hostage and re-open the government.
Absolutely shameful the Violence Against Women Act has expired due to Republican’s incompetence.  https://t.co/CipIddyrT6
Trump’s wall is a waste of taxpayer’s money and an insult to our nation’s values. #ReasonsNotToBuildTheWall
This shutdown is completely on Trump. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill to keep the government open — and he rejected it. Now federal employees are paying the price of his temper tantrum during the holidays.
It’s clear that Trump doesn’t want to negotiate, he wants to hold the government hostage over his hateful, wasteful, and un-American border wall. #TrumpShutdown
Better uses of $5.7 billion than a wall: ✅Revitalizing our nation’s infrastructure ✅Investing in quality education for our children ✅Medicare for All ✅Address affordable housing
Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. You would think they’d at least be able to keep the government open.
Today's the #WinterSolstice, which marks the shortest day of the year. But for many federal workers, it's going to feel like the longest day of the year while they wait to see whether or not they'll be furloughed or forced to work without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown.
Trump 10 days ago: “I am proud to shut down the government…I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.”  Trump now: “The Democrats now own the shutdown!” https://t.co/JqzSRjvfrR
Not surprisingly, abstinence-only sex education puts young people’s health at risk. We can’t let the Trump Administration throw out science and the proven Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program to push their regressive ineffective agenda.  https://t.co/xVsvLge6GQ
In 2019, we must fight for an economy that's built not from the top down but from the middle out and provides opportunity for those aspiring to join the middle class. And we make ending poverty a national priority.
After a bipartisan funding bill passed the Senate yesterday, Trump is now having a temper tantrum, refusing to sign the bill if it passes the House and arrives on his desk. This childish behavior is only going to hurt our country. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/qtPD1sJtiC
While I agree we must bring home our troops in Syria as soon as possible and end unauthorized forever wars, the manner in which we do it MATTERS. We can't continue to have a commander-in-tweets instead of a commander-in-chief.

No matter how many times Republicans fail to repeal our health care, they just can’t stop their attacks. From their countless bills to repeal, to their efforts to sabotage Americans’ ability to access affordable care, it’s clear that the GOP won’t give up — we can’t either.

Congress has abdicated its responsibility to debate our wars for far too long. Giving any president a blank check to wage perpetual war is a mistake that must be corrected. @SpeakerRyan has the chance to correct that this week by bringing the war powers resolution for a vote.

Shirley Chisholm told her colleagues after she won her election for the House, “I have no intention of just sitting quietly and observing. I intend to focus on the nation’s problems.” Let’s all heed her advice and speak out about the issues facing our nation.

To honor the memories of the lives lost at Sandy Hook, it is past time we take the basic steps of closing loopholes &amp; expanding background checks. Children shouldn’t fear for their lives while learning fractions. We can’t give up on commonsense gun reforms.

It’s unbelievable that six years after 26 innocent children and educators were murdered at Sandy Hook, Congress has yet to do anything to end the gun violence epidemic. It is a public health crisis. Enough is enough. Time to pass commonsense gun safety reform.
Yesterday the Senate stood on the right side of history and voted to pass our resolution to end U.S. involvement in the catastrophic war in Yemen. Now it’s time for @SpeakerRyan to bring it up for a vote in the House so we can take one step closer to peace. #YemenCantWait

I first met Shirley Chisholm when I was a student at Mills College. She later inspired me to get off the sidelines &amp; run for office. She used to always say, “You don’t make progress by sitting on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas.”
Shirley Chisholm was born today in 1924. Throughout her life, she showed African American women (myself included) that there was a path for us in politics. And by articulating a progressive vision, she modeled a more inclusive brand of leadership — one that still resonates today.

Once again the Trump Administration is proposing to separate children from their families at the border and inflicting even more trauma on families seeking safe harbor from the violence and abuse they left behind. We can’t let them repeat the mistakes from our past.

No parent should worry about their family’s safety when visiting the park or attending the movies. No American should have to weigh the risks of gun violence in their classroom or their office or their favorite club. It’s time for common sense gun safety reform.

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford risked her safety and her privacy to report her assault. Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed. #BelieveSurvivors
According to RAINN, every 98 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. Confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court tells these Americans that their assaults don’t matter. It also tells those who perpetuate assault that their actions won’t have consequences.
We cannot let Senate Republicans refuse to believe survivors and shut out the voices of those who have been sexually assaulted.  https://t.co/nQwGtSRYxD

It takes courage to break down racist and sexist barriers in politics, but guess what? Women of color are some of the most courageous people in this country. We must demand a seat at the table and stay there until we’re heard.

Happy birthday, California! On this day 168 years ago, California became the 31st state. Extremely proud our state continues to lead the way on environmental protection, civil rights, and more.
Forcing children and their parents apart will have profoundly negative effects for the rest of their lives. We cannot stand for this.  https://t.co/pfUCQlHdkZ
Raising the minimum wage is imperative to a healthier economy and curbing economic injustice. Six major U.S. cities have raised the minimum wage with no harm to job growth; this is significant proof that it’s time to pay workers more of what they deserve. https://t.co/ummouFKwu9
Alicia Baker spoke at the Kavanaugh hearings yesterday about how, as a Christian, she opposes Kavanaugh because of his views on women’s reproductive health. Read her op-ed from last month:  https://t.co/TCNtQb5VjC
Immigrants are turning down essential assistance, like help buying infant formula and healthy food for their children because they are afraid Trump will stop them from obtaining green cards for taking federal aid. https://t.co/PJABkeu5rH
Republicans continue to let down families by favoring the wealthy over the most vulnerable. Under the new House Farm Bill, supported by the president, two million low-income Americans would lose their benefits. This is a disgrace. https://t.co/zpShwnV1Oe
Climate change is a global catastrophe. I will continue to stand up to climate change deniers in the White House and fight for environmental protections.  https://t.co/fDkV341Bsy
In a leaked email, Judge Kavanaugh expressed that Roe v. Wade could be easily overturned. The rights of all women are in danger if he is confirmed. We must keep up the pressure.  https://t.co/AJkyvtWPXc
President @BarackObama is right, we need more women in charge. Let's elect them into office this November 💪🏽 https://t.co/hLMUF6ssic
Yesterday Kavanaugh wrongly called birth control “abortion-inducing drugs.” Just further proof that he is a threat to women’s reproductive freedom.
The Trump Administration announced yesterday their plan to hold migrant children in detention indefinitely. These children need us to do something. Stand with me to oppose this heartless decision.  https://t.co/hPMa9dzFzM
While big corporations are seeing record profits, wages for middle and low-income Americans, especially communities of color, have stagnated. It’s long overdue that we change the rigged system so that working families — not corporate profits — come first.
History is being made across the country this election year because people like you are rising up and throwing your support behind progressive leaders. Let’s keep the momentum going by registering to vote at https://t.co/hV5py4qUvD.
Nearly 500 children remain separated. I haven’t forgotten about them and I hope you haven’t either.  https://t.co/Gce4JaxYhQ
We can’t go back to: 👉🏾The days of back-alley abortions. 👉🏾The days when just being a woman was a pre-existing condition. 👉🏾The days when this country denied access to health care for low-income women and women of color.  We must #StopKavanaugh.
Time is running out to build the public pressure necessary to convince the Senate to reject Kavanaugh. Call your Senators and tell them to vote NO — women’s rights, workers rights, voting rights, LGBTQ rights, our environment, and health care is at stake.
This Administration is once again doing the unthinkable and throwing out a 20-year ban on indefinite detention. This is cruel and immoral.  https://t.co/rMo6e2SFqQ
What's happening in Yemen is a humanitarian catastrophe. My colleagues and I will be introducing a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. forces from the war in Yemen. We must take action to bring about a peaceful conclusion to this conflict.
Our access to reproductive health care is at stake with Kavanaugh’s nomination. https://t.co/ucScKKUWka
Today marks one year since Trump tried — and failed — to end DACA. We must continue to commit to protecting immigrants and giving them a permanent path forward in the country they call home.

Congratulations to @AyannaPressley on her groundbreaking victory last night — making it likely she’ll become Massachusetts’ very first Black woman in Congress.
Kavanaugh is a dangerous nominee who could roll back our rights for women, workers, voters, LGBTQ Americans, our environment and healthcare. Here are 3 things you can do to help stop his appointment: https://t.co/qfkWznssVC
While the deadline to reunite separated children was over a month ago, almost 500 children remain separated from their families. This is a human rights disgrace; we can’t count on the Trump administration to keep their promises or protect family values. https://t.co/7WghU4KCxH
On this day in history, nine Black Little Rock students were denied entry to Central High School on the first day they started at an all-white school. Their courage and bravery in the face of hate is inspiring. https://t.co/7vhAgun8qn
This is extremely concerning: 57% of Americans have been billed unexpectedly for services that they thought health insurance would cover— sometimes up to thousands of dollars. Quality, affordable &amp; accessible health care should be a right, not a privilege. https://t.co/E1hgQBJTQd
Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber stamp for the Trump agenda, which is why Republicans are trying to rush through his nomination. Let’s do everything we can to stop him. Call your Senators today at (202) 224-3121.
Last night — just hours before Kavanaugh’s hearings began — 42,000 pages of additional Kavanaugh documents were released to the U.S. Senate. There’s too much at stake to rush this process.
This #LaborDay, let's thank our labor brothers and sisters for fighting every day for fair wages, safe working conditions, protecting the middle class and pushing back against workplace discrimination. Let's keep up the fight alongside them ✊🏾
Gun violence is a public health epidemic. The United States is one of the top six countries that make up more than half of gun deaths worldwide. Senseless gun violence is rampant; we need background checks and an assault weapons ban now. https://t.co/6xyvgt0sOR

Without a doubt, President Trump is doing everything he can to stall the Mueller investigation. Congress needs to pass legislation now to protect Robert Mueller before it’s too late.
Kavanaugh’s nomination is a fight for our fundamental rights — from LGBTQ, worker, and women’s freedoms. Call your senators. Send those tweets. Write and march and shout until we win. #StopKavanaugh
This is horrifying. No child should ever be imprisoned and denied medical care for any reason — especially by the federal government. https://t.co/lTmQW48MgN
Only 3% of Judge Kavanaugh’s records, including his time doing partisan work for the Bush Administration, have been released. Yet Republicans are pushing to start his confirmation hearings in less than a week. Why the rush despite the lack of transparency? #StopKavanaugh

Emmett Till was brutally beaten and murdered 63 years ago today. Even today, when lynching still isn’t a federal crime and Black lives aren’t valued by the justice system, we must continue to speak out and declare that #BlackLivesMatter.
Republicans hope to start hearings for President Trump’s dangerous Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, just one week from tomorrow. There’s no time to waste: add your name to help protect our rights and #StopKavanaugh now https://t.co/RAIlNT8zVM
Passing common-sense gun reforms will save lives. Here’s what we need to fight for: ✅ Universal background checks ✅ Assault weapons ban ✅ Address gun violence as a public health epidemic
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: lawmakers who are willing to trade the safety of our communities for cash from the gun lobby do not deserve the honor of serving in Congress.
Deeply saddened to hear of the tragic mass shooting in Jacksonville, Florida yesterday. My heart goes out to the loved ones of those injured and lost to this senseless gun violence.
It’s not just women’s reproductive freedom that’s potentially on the chopping block: gun reform, LGBTQ rights, workers’ rights, and the fundamental right to vote are all on the line. Call your senators, go to town halls, and write to your local papers to #StopKavanaugh now
I remember:  🔴The days of back alley abortions. 🔴The days when just being a woman was a pre-existing condition. 🔴The days when this country denied access to health care for low-income women and women of color.  We cannot, we should not, we must not go back to those dark days.
Like I said at today’s @NARAL rally, make no mistake: Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber stamp for the Trump agenda, including their plans to end Roe v. Wade as we know it. Who will suffer? Women. That’s why we must rise up, stay woke, and #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/hU2L9auyDO

Senator John McCain was a dedicated public servant, a courageous leader, and a fair and trusted colleague. My prayers are with his family during this difficult time.

President Trump is unhinged, blaming Cohen for “flipping” and declaring he should be leading the investigation into his own campaign, not the Special Counsel. It’s up to Congress to protect Robert Mueller at all costs: add your name and urge them to do so. https://t.co/zIquaKKaUr
Even young children are being targeted and killed in the military bombings in war-torn Yemen. This war is currently the world’s worst humanitarian crisis – we must do more to prevent civilian deaths, especially the targeting of innocent children. https://t.co/4YSDBBaue2
While we fight the chaos and corruption of the Trump campaign, we can’t let ourselves forget about the GOP’s plans to: ❌ Repeal health care after the midterms ❌ Slash Medicare and Social Security ❌ Rush through an anti-choice SCOTUS nominee
Trump promised to hire “the best people.” Yet 4 of his campaign associates have been charged with breaking the law, and he’s lashing out at the Special Counsel. We must protect Robert Mueller at all costs and stop Trump from obstructing justice.  https://t.co/QRa73SplXB
The GOP is trying to rush through Trump’s SCOTUS nominee even as members of his inner circle are found guilty of breaking the law. We can’t let this corrupt president appoint a justice to the bench for a lifetime.  Call your Senators: tell them to block Kavanaugh’s confirmation

Maya Angelou once said, “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.” Trump said he’d nominate a justice to the Supreme Court who’d get rid of Roe. We should believe him — the first time.
Democrats in races across the country have the chance to flip their districts from red to blue. Every race is critical to taking back the House so we have a fighting chance to further resist harmful policies pushed by the Trump Administration and GOP. Let’s turn out the vote.
Pollution can have devastating effects on our nation’s public health. Trump’s plan would lead to an increase of up to 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 — while Obama’s Clean Power Plan would have reduced deaths.  https://t.co/RPjpcLAWlX

I’m going to do whatever it takes to make sure we elect Democrats to the House. But I need your help. Register to vote, knock on doors, and talk to your friends and family about what’s at stake. We’re going to need all hands on deck to make this happen.
One year ago today the Senate shot down Republicans’ attempts to dismantle health care. But threats to the Affordable Care Act still exist and we can’t become complacent.

Congress must get serious about fixing our broken immigration system. Our immigrant brothers and sisters — and most of all, children — must be treated with dignity, compassion, and respect.
No more jailing children. No more separating families. Time to pass the Keeping Families Together Act to stop this atrocity from happening again.  https://t.co/wNG96WmBDh
ICYMI: Earlier this week I introduced an amendment in the House Appropriations Committee that would end the practice of ICE shackling pregnant women and denying them medical access.  Republicans voted it down.

It’s absolutely heartbreaking that this Administration is purposely tricking parents into giving up their reunification rights — just so they can say they beat the deadline today. This is one of the most shameful stains on our country’s history.  https://t.co/cqlVfmBI1u
One thing is clear: there was never a plan to reunite these kids with their families. #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/aKwOWJdhmg
When I visited the detention centers, I witnessed the terrible conditions immigrants have to live through. Terrified kids were sleeping on concrete floors. Mothers unsure if they’d see their children again. Some parents didn’t even have a phone number to reach their kids.

It’s no secret that Trump views immigrants with disdain. He has called Mexicans “rapists” and referred to immigrants as “animals.” His Administration has embraced nativist dog whistles from day one. Nowhere is this clearer than the shameful “zero tolerance” policy they enacted.
Ending the policy of separating families — but forcing kids to live in jail for months on end — is just replacing one form of child abuse with another.  These human rights violations must end.

This isn’t the 1st time the US has separated young children of color from their parents.   Happened during the Middle Passage. Black slaves sold by owners at will.  Native Americans forced to send their children to gov boarding schools.   We can’t repeat the mistakes of the past.
While this Administration tries to claim the War on Poverty is “largely over and a success,” we know better. 14% of Americans are living in poverty today, especially impacting children and seniors. We can’t turn our backs on them.

Roe v. Wade protects a woman’s right to choose what to do with her own body, yet that fundamental right hangs in the balance because of Justice Kennedy’s retirement. We must push back against this Administration’s anti-women agenda.
No matter what’s happening in the news, we must continue to speak out about issues like health care, affordable housing, climate change, and debt-free college.
People of conscience across the country must continue to voice their opposition to hatred, bigotry, and racism. And I will continue to sound the alarm in Congress and denounce the divisive, xenophobic and dangerous policies of Trump and Congressional Republicans.

Republicans might be willing to accept Donald Trump and his regressive and racist policies, but Democrats and every day Americans do not. It's time for us to stand together as a party, take back the House, and continue the progress we’ve made under President Obama.
With Justice Kennedy’s impending retirement, our fundamental rights hang in the balance. And if this week's SCOTUS decisions, that have endorsed misogyny, bigotry, and xenophobia, are any indication of where this country is heading, Democrats have to win November, and win big.

Don’t forget: All the recent horrible Supreme Court decisions is a consequence of Trump and Mitch McConnell pushing through Justice Gorsuch. We won’t allow anti-women Republicans to dictate what care women should receive.

ICYMI 👇🏽 “The Pot Industry Is Overwhelmingly White, and One Congresswoman Wants to Change That” https://t.co/KDeMmxd08u
We should be doing everything we can to protect the environment. This administration's plan to expand offshore drilling is dangerous and puts California’s coastline at risk.
The RESPECT Resolution would: ✅Address the systemic exclusion and discrimination in the pot industry ✅Urge states to expunge records of people incarcerated for nonviolent marijuana offenses ✅Encourage states to have diverse marijuana regulatory boards
Only 20% of the current House was serving in Congress when the 2001 AUMF passed. We owe it to our troops to have a long-overdue debate about the costs and consequences of these forever wars.
It’s been a little over four months since the shooting at Parkland. Gun violence is an American epidemic and Congress needs to do more than another moment of silence.
I’m proud to join my progressive colleagues in calling on Secretary of Defense Mattis to withdraw support from a military operation in Yemen that could unleash a humanitarian disaster on millions.
There is an appalling rate of poverty in our country yet Republicans are pushing policies that create more, not less, poverty. Something must change.  https://t.co/iFm2xfi495
The fight for #NetNeutrality is really about fairness: We can't let large corporations control our online experience — or anyone else for that matter.
Republicans are continuing their assault on people with pre-existing conditions and want to go back to a time when they could be denied coverage or charged more for care. It’s shameful.
We must protect our coast, one of our nation’s greatest treasures, from industrial offshore drilling at all costs. #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/UTzM8PRi25
I am deeply disappointed that yesterday my Republican colleagues reversed their position on my amendment to sunset the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. The U.S. cannot continue to write a blank check for any president to wage war.
Fewer than 1% of all marijuana dispensaries are owned by African Americans, yet are on average three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana. I introduced the RESPECT Resolution, the first legislation ever that deals with racial disparity in the pot industry. https://t.co/KDeMmxd08u

Americans must stand strong against the war hawks in Trump’s cabinet who are looking for any opportunity to use recent talks as a pretext for war. We have an opportunity for permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and we can’t waste it.
Congratulations @LondonBreed for becoming the next mayor of San Francisco—and the city’s first African American woman mayor! Her proven track record of fighting for affordable housing and taking on difficult challenges will make San Francisco a more just, equitable place for all.

“Although the racial disparity in early death has narrowed in recent decades, black people have the life expectancy, nationwide, that white people had in the 1980s — about three years shorter than the current white life expectancy."  This is a public health emergency. https://t.co/fW2B6IxhX6
A powerful moment last night at the Tony Awards.  https://t.co/19FZMSFZ1S
As of today, the repeal of #NetNeutrality officially goes into effect. This isn’t over yet though. The House GOP can act to keep the internet free, fair, and open.
Voting should not be considered a "use-it-or-lose-it” right. This is an intentional attempt to suppress minority and low-income voters from participating in our democracy.  https://t.co/gckHfo4GiT
Americans rely on #NetNeutrality every day – to study, work, organize and create. It’s been almost a month since the Senate passed a bill restoring it but @SpeakerRyan has yet to bring it to the House floor. What is he waiting for?
As many are moving their tassel onto the other side of their caps this month, let’s not forget many of today’s students and grads carry a combined $1.5 trillion in outstanding debt. We must do more to help alleviate the costs of seeking a higher education.

Our government has the resources to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to move into the middle class. However, the priorities of the Republican party are holding back access to the American dream.
My amendment to the Energy-Water appropriations bill tries to prevent the Pentagon from developing new low-yield, submarine-launched nuclear weapons. The House will be voting on the amendment tomorrow and I am urging my colleagues to vote YES.

This year’s National Defense Authorization Act that passed the House does nothing to compel a debate on endless wars and refuses to address wasteful Pentagon spending.

Banning Planned Parenthood and other professionals from providing abortions if they are funded by Title X is shameful. This move will disproportionately hurt millions of low-income women and women of color.

Teachers spend on average $500 buying supplies for their students. That’s $$$ taken out of their own pocket to buy pencils, pens, crayons, paper, and more.   It’s shameful that as a country teachers don’t receive the resources they need to teach.
Large telecom companies already have too much power. If we don’t save #NetNeutrality, it will continue to swing in their direction. We must bring this issue to the floor of the House.
Make no mistake, attacks on Title X aren't about Planned Parenthood or abortion — they’re about the GOP trying to control women's bodies. We won’t stand for it.

Confirming Gina Haspel would mean another member is added to Trump’s growing war cabinet. This war cabinet is a threat to human rights, diplomacy, and peace. The Senate needs to reject her nomination. #NoHaspel

President Trump has consistently demonstrated the poor grasp he has on matters of international diplomacy and this week’s decision about the Iran Deal further highlights his inability to protect U.S. interests abroad.

The Trump Administration is doing nothing to address police misconduct. In fact, their policies take us back. We must hold this administration accountable for their lawlessness.
Failing to uphold the Iran Deal puts the United States at risk, alienates our allies, and undermines years of diplomacy. In these contentious times, it would be a grave mistake for the U.S. to abandon our allies and bring us back to the brink of war.
The GOP gave a trillion dollar tax cut to the wealthy, now they want to cut food from the poor. This is despicable on every level.

For far too many years, Republicans in Congress have chosen to demonize struggling families instead of offering them a helping hand. Let’s remember that when we head to the voting booth this November.
While hashtags are a great way to spread awareness, Congress needs to support our teachers 365 days a year and make sure they have the funds and resources at their disposal to give our children a high-quality education. #TeacherAppreciationWeek
A good message for us all to remember. #MondayMotivation https://t.co/o9vckjewEc
Every week should be #TeacherAppreciationWeek. We must support our teachers and make sure they have the resources to give our children the opportunity to succeed. #ThankATeacher
As a former social worker, I’m committed to ensuring everyone has access to health care for not only their physical well being, but for their mental well being as well. #MentalHealthMonth
This is another attack on women’s rights, low-income women, and women of color who rely on reproductive health organizations that receive this funding. https://t.co/VavqX1nZDb
We have a choice to make this November: we can put our country back in the hands of compassionate public servants or continue letting the GOP discourage progress. My hope is that we choose the first option.
I am excited to stand with @stevenhorsford who will be a powerful voice for the people in Congress. If elected, he will help hold this president accountable and stand up for our health care and human rights. #Horsford4Congress https://t.co/e8lUEQYKRw
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: Title X funds can't go toward abortion services and are used for other health care needs at clinics that also provide abortions, such as birth control, well-woman exams, and cancer screenings.
ICYMI: This week, along with some of my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, went Silicon Valley to speak about the need for greater diversity in the tech industry.  https://t.co/fBkVgjTkJp
People like you are the ones who are going to take our country back from an unhinged president who applauded himself for advancing policies that hurt communities of color and the poor. How? By voting in November. Go to https://t.co/hV5py4qUvD now.
Jasmine Harrison’s determination and hard work led to her acceptance at 113 colleges and universities. This is the definition of #blackgirlmagic.  https://t.co/XXXJqHmknb
Reducing fuel economy standards has absolutely no benefit. We’ve got to reduce emissions in an attempt to overcome the terrible effects of air pollution.  https://t.co/b9UTwfAw2Q
Here are the facts: More than 80% of SNAP households worked in the year before or the year after receiving SNAP. Work rates are even higher for families with children, with more than 60% working while receiving SNAP, and almost 90% working in the prior or subsequent year.
I will not silently stand by and watch our government strip away women’s reproductive rights. I’m going to need you to stand with me and continue to fight for a woman’s right to safe, accessible health care.
It’s impossible to ignore the role privilege plays when looking at the effects of air pollution, sea-level rise, and global warming.  https://t.co/tLgXC9Y8bu
I was the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force following the horrific attacks on September 11th. I knew that the authorization would grant any president a blank check for endless war, and sadly that is exactly what it did.
We’re running out of time to close the racial wealth divide in America. With immediate action and bold policies on the local, state and federal level, we can close this divide and clear a pathway to the middle class for all Americans.
The integrity of our elections were compromised in the 2016 election. It would be downright negligent not to address it in upcoming elections.  https://t.co/RL7s3hmJ9x
Today marks the one year anniversary of when Trump and House Republicans gleefully celebrated voting to strip away health care for millions of Americans and hike premiums. Their efforts failed, but I won’t give up fighting to ensure that health care is a human right. https://t.co/dNNVFdBhHf
Trump led the birther movement to question the legitimacy of Barack Obama — our first African American President. Instead of rejecting Trump's racist attacks, the Republican Party threw their support behind him. They haven’t stopped bending to his every whim ever since.
If the Trump Administration won’t stand up and protect our environment, California will.  https://t.co/b9UTwfAw2Q
Time and again, politicians have not only ignored the daily struggles and realities of women’s lives, but also attempted to interfere in our most personal decisions. This would have a devastating effect if implemented.  https://t.co/qCxNU2B4sK
Silicon Valley's economy is booming but we still don't have the parity and equity in terms of racial inclusion. It’s mind-boggling this hasn’t been addressed.  https://t.co/Xgi9BeTdSa
Demonizing struggling families instead of offering them a helping hand will only continue to increase poverty and hunger in our communities. https://t.co/nqaA4HeLWt
I promise to do everything I can to resist the rise of hatred and divisiveness and support the progressive wave we are seeing in this country, but I cannot do it alone. RT if you’re with me.
Last month, Trump issued an executive order to made good on his promise to diminish essential services like food stamps. Instead of choosing to help Americans, President Trump decided to cut basic living programs for countless families. It’s appalling.

People’s pain isn’t always obvious. That’s why early support and encouragement to reach out is so important. #EachMindMatters https://t.co/nTVl1qtSvE
The dream of a college degree continues to move further and further out of reach for so many young people due to the rising costs of college. It’s imperative Congress works to level the economic playing field.
Instead of working to unite our divided nation, Trump has doubled down on his dangerous partnership with the alt-right, insiders, and the elite. We must continue to resist their destructive agenda on the American people.
As a former psychiatric social worker, I know how important it is to provide all people with high-quality mental health services and care. Today marks the first day of #MentalHealthMonth, a time to help spread mental health awareness and end stigma.
Let us recommit this #MayDay to fighting against injustices for American workers. We must speak out for economic equality and social justice by working to raise the minimum wage and ensure paid family leave.
The continued attacks on SNAP are incredibly shameful, immoral, and wrong. Make no mistake, these draconian changes will only increase poverty and hunger in our communities.
It’s been 465 days since Donald Trump took office. During that time he has normalized the extreme fringes of the Republican Party by advancing policies that hurt people of color, immigrants, DREAMers, the poor, and middle-class families. We must keep fighting against it.
.@CecileRichards, thank you for leadership at Planned Parenthood, even in the face of relentless attacks. Your hard work and dedication will never be forgotten. #ThankYouCecile
With so much at stake, we must continue building the resistance. Pitch in now to help me defend people who are at risk under Trump’s administration. https://t.co/ofUlv0nRfT
In case it wasn’t already clear, Trump works for the NRA, not the American people.  https://t.co/SuOCKH9MRY
ICYMI: I wrote an op-ed about a bill that would lock SNAP recipients out of the program for up to three years if they fail to find work or enroll in job training. This bill perpetuates false and racist stereotypes. https://t.co/JaR6OYoBQN
Families should not be punished for being poor. And no one should ever have to choose between feeding their families or paying for medicine. But that is exactly what Republicans in Congress and the Trump Administration want to do.  This is incredibly shameful, immoral, and wrong.
There are millions of people in the United States for whom hunger is a daily issue and who rely on food stamps to get by.  https://t.co/DDFLALkStr
As a nation, we must ensure that every student, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to access a high quality, affordable education.
Excited to speak with tech executives next week about the need to address equity and parity in the workforce. #CBCTech2020 https://t.co/eXeHfJyaet
Maya Angelou once said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them.” President Trump has shown us exactly who he is by surrounding himself with men who have spent their careers trying to take healthcare away from women.
Since taking office, I’ve fought for a decent living wage, a quality and affordable college education, and for everyone to have access to health care.
I support teachers who are standing up for their students. Teachers should not have to take money out of their own pockets to buy desks and chairs for their classroom.  https://t.co/HWI11DPwHZ
Scott Pruitt has abused taxpayer money and set a new low for unethical behavior. It’s time Trump tells him “you’re fired!” https://t.co/PZKGMvNeiC
When I was a young single mother raising my sons, I relied on food stamps during a very difficult period in my life. They were a “bridge over troubled water” but today, these vital programs are under attack by this Administration. We must stand up for SNAP.
Scott Pruitt is not fit to be the person in charge of protecting our environment. Pruitt has refused to lead on climate change (or even take its existence seriously), has rolled back years of environmental progress, and he’s prioritized polluters over the American people.
Transgender members of our military put their lives on the line every day for our country and deserve the opportunity to serve if they wish to do so.  https://t.co/ttv8uQG89G

As this week marks the 10th anniversary of the ACA being signed into law, we’re reminded that access to health care for millions &amp; protections for people with pre-existing conditions are on the line. If we’re going to #ProtectOurCare, then we need to #FlipTheSenate in November.

Now, the fate of health care for millions who were uninsured before the ACA and for millions with a pre-existing condition hangs in the balance.   So we’ll keep repeating it: Democrats won’t back down in the fight to #ProtectOurCare, and that’s why we need to #FlipTheSenate.
One year later, Trump has doubled down on his desire to repeal the law and Republicans continue to push forward with their toxic health care lawsuit that will now be heard by the Supreme Court.
One year ago, the Trump admin escalated Republicans’ crusade to increase costs and rip away health care from millions of Americans when it asked the courts to strike down the entire ACA—including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Take a look at the Republicans who refuse to stand up to #TXvUS — their party’s lawsuit aimed at repealing the ACA, gutting coverage protections for pre-existing conditions, and spiking costs.   Side note: Everyone below is ALSO up for re-election in 2020. https://t.co/SmVVbLX5Bg

We only need to flip four seats to take back the Senate. Here are four GOP senators with approval ratings below 40% we’re fighting to defeat 👉 Thom Tillis, Cory Gardner, Joni Ernst, and Martha McSally.
If the GOP gets its way in the #TXvUS lawsuit to overturn the ACA, they have no replacement plan. So instead of changing course, they’re just going to try to hide the toxic consequences until after next year’s election.  Time to hold them accountable — and in 2020, vote them out.

Climate change is real and we’re already feeling the impacts. So we’ll continue to say it: We can’t make climate action a priority until we #FlipTheSenate in 2020. https://t.co/eqh6dhglPR
Meanwhile, vulnerable Senate GOP incumbents continue to remain silent as the Trump administration’s raid on millions in funding for military projects in their home states moves forward. https://t.co/nL9yTkhtoj
Things aren't looking good for Thom Tillis. After his “Olympic gold flip-flop” on Trump’s sham emergency declaration, he was booed *twice* at a GOP rally this week. Now he’s dumping MILLIONS on ads to try to beat a primary challenger.
Here’s what we know: Russia targeted all 50 states in the 2016 election and they plan to target our elections again in 2020. So why is McConnell blocking election security legislation? https://t.co/LYGlhH1HP0
Thom Tillis is panicking. He’s lost credibility among North Carolina Republican voters, earned himself a primary challenger, and now his campaign is preparing to spend $2.2 million on ads for his GOP primary. #NCSen https://t.co/xYCV2ZanjI
Vulnerable Republican senators who supported Trump’s sham emergency declaration made it possible for Trump to divert billions of dollars from military construction projects. Now, they're doing nothing to protect their state’s needs.   In 2020, voters will hold them accountable.

From thwarting commonsense gun safety reforms like expanding background checks to opposing campaign finance reform and blocking bipartisan measures to secure our elections, McConnell just keeps showing us he only cares about serving himself and his special interest friends.
This is still true: Republicans haven’t given up on their dangerous health care agenda that would drive up premiums, end popular protections, and drag down the quality of care. So let’s continue to hold Senate Republicans accountable and vote them out in 2020.

Senate Republicans can keep supporting a reckless health care plan that drives up costs and drags down the quality of care for older Americans, women, the most vulnerable, and millions more, but Senate Democrats aren't going to stop fighting to #ProtectOurCare.
Here’s how Mitch McConnell talks about the health care law that protects 881,000 Kentuckians with pre-existing conditions: https://t.co/vNp73awVeZ

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that for-profit employers could deny birth control coverage to their employees. This ruling and recent Republican-led attacks continue to show that we can’t stop fighting to protect women’s health and rights.

Why is Susan Collins facing a tough re-election? Her record doesn’t put Mainers first: ✅Voted w/ Trump 94% of the time ✅Voted for the #GOPTaxScam that experts called a “corporate giveaway” ✅Voted for dozens of Trump’s nominees—including anti-choice judges like Brett Kavanaugh

You can read more about how we're adapting to the COVID-19 outbreak at https://t.co/UqhNAN9zTK
We have shifted to an all-digital delegate selection process, but as has been true from the beginning of our primary, both presidential campaigns who received pledged delegates will retain the right of refusal over who is selected to fill each of their pledged delegate positions.
Those vote totals translate into 46 pledged delegates for @JoeBiden and 43 pledged delegates for @BernieSanders to the Democratic National Convention in July.
Congratulations to both @JoeBiden &amp; @BernieSanders on receiving pledged delegates from Washington’s first Democratic presidential primary! ~1.6 million Democratic voters cast a ballot, resulting in 591,403 votes for Vice President Biden and 570,039 votes for Sen. Sanders. #waelex

If we want to live in a society that is just and equal, when we say "if you are sick, stay home" we need to equip all working Americans with the ability to do so.
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Americans should not have to sacrifice their health to put food on the table. With the ideas of isolation luring over communities across the country, that's just simply not a choice for impoverished and working-class families.
This legislation, if passed, would give 14 paid sick days in public health emergencies like the one we are facing right now.   https://t.co/RYYyO5oWcc
In her op-ed, Sen. @PattyMurray writes "Here’s the problem: 32 million people in our country have no paid sick days. In other words, for one-in-four workers, taking one of the most impactful steps we can to combat the virus could mean losing a paycheck or potentially a job."
Sen. @PattyMurray writes this op-ed for Cosmopolitan Magazine to condemn the GOP and their efforts to block legislation that could help employees in the U.S. prioritize their health and well-being over concerns of financial hardship.

The cowardice showed by @HerreraBeutler &amp; @RepNewhouse is especially galling because they both sit on the Appropriations Committee, which means Trump's disregard for Congress' constitutional authority to authorize the aid intended for Ukraine was a direct rebuke of them too. 4/ https://t.co/XJJtcmfGir
Instead, they sent a signal to Trump that they don't believe he should face consequences for his rampant corruption.   Apparently, they think it's fine for him to withhold military aid from a US ally being invaded by Russia until our ally agrees to help him win reelection. 3/
In today's #impeachment vote, all 3 @WAGOP members had a chance to hold the president accountable for corrupting our foreign policy for his own political gain.

Join us in celebrating #IndigenousPeoplesDay, a day of resiliency to honor the preservation of the Native culture.
Here at WA Dems, we're actively working to expand the Native voting rights and organizing with our Tribal communities to make sure their voices are heard in our democracy. #IndigenousPeoplesDay
Instead, as we observe #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we're reflecting on the centuries of violence that the Native people have experienced and the current epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous Women.
Happy #IndigenousPeoplesDay! Washington has a rich history of indigenous cultures &amp; we are home to 29 federally recognized tribes! Out of respect for our Native friends and partners, we're choosing not to celebrate today as "Columbus Day." https://t.co/v1yP34SJ7T

For veterans with service-connected infertility, this ban often puts having children out of reach. Working with @MurrayCampaign, Rick is leading the charge in the House, getting the VA ban on IVF &amp; adoption assistance temporarily lifted &amp; working to permanently repeal it. 9/
Rick knows how much servicemembers sacrifice and firmly believes they should not have to sacrifice their dreams of starting a family. Unfortunately, an outdated law has long prohibited the VA from paying for IVF and adoption assistance. 8/
Since 2001, more than 1.1 million acres of spawning &amp; rearing habitat have been restored &amp; protected for salmon, &amp; access for salmon to over 10,550 miles (equal to 44 times the width of WA!) of previously inaccessible streams was restored due to the funding Rick helped secure. 7/
While we prepare the next generation for a 21st-century economy, Rick is also fighting to protect our region’s natural habitats. He’s a champion of the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund which protects 27 species of salmon and steelhead from extinction. 6/
The YAAJA expands programs that connect high school students with low-cost community college programs and in-demand apprenticeships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. 5/
A strong aerospace sector means a strong WA: the industry employs more than 136,000 people in 35 of our 39 counties. To make sure that our children are growing up ready to fill those 136,000 aerospace jobs, Rick introduced the Youth Access to American Jobs Act this year. 4/
WA ranks as the best place on the planet for aerospace manufacturing &amp; Rick’s leadership as chair of the Aviation Subcommittee ensures our aerospace industry continues to thrive in a competitive and changing global market. 3/
Rick is a champion for the middle class. This means working to build an economy that creates jobs, protecting our environment, helping our communities address the pain of opioid addiction and ensuring our veterans have access to the care and services they need. 2/

Thanks for all your hard work helping us make 2018 a resounding success for Democrats in Washington State! Together, we can accomplish even more in 2019! #WADems2018 #WADems2019
Not only did we flip 10 Republican-held legislative seats and 1 Republican-held congressional seat, but we didn’t allow Republicans to flip a single one of ours. #WADems2018 https://t.co/h1V7uCJ9Aq
Which means this also happened. @DrKimSchrier for the win! #WADems2018 https://t.co/EdoduT4dwv
Oh yeah, and this happened. #WADems2018 https://t.co/cHrWoqp5ar
We dramatically increased Democrats’ vote share. If you add up all of the general election votes for legislative candidates statewide, Democrats in 2018 improved their share of the total vote by 14% over 2016. #WADems2018 https://t.co/7LYORayYaE
...and in the state House by 14 seats. #WADems2018 https://t.co/psYqRnXw9F
That means that we expanded the Democratic majority over Republicans in the state Senate by 6 seats... #WADems2018 https://t.co/z6TbHvOSEI
And we flipped seven state House seats that were held by Republicans. #WADems2018 https://t.co/xbtksctnpP
And all our work paid off in big ways! For example, we flipped three state Senate seats from red to blue this year. #WADems2018 https://t.co/5Ua4bIbTt8
Julie Johnson is member of the Lummi Nation and a resident of Neah Bay, Washington. Julie is a Democrat because her own experiences instilled in her the importance of treating people fairly. #WeAreDemocrats https://t.co/ZvgtehUwCR
We made digital ads to get out the vote in six different languages, and they were viewed hundreds of thousands of times in the week leading up to Election Day. #WADems2018 https://t.co/Raij6kKLDM
In 2018, we worked constantly to communicate our goals through compelling digital media. #WADems2018 https://t.co/h9NjDePeoC
When we say we were operating all over the state, we mean ALL OVER the state. #WADems2018 https://t.co/6vpK1OIXEk
And completed nearly 2.1 million door knocks, phone calls, and text messages. #WADems2018 https://t.co/yyCdGmWbkE
In all, our volunteers completed over 17,000 shifts this year to get out the vote for Democrats. #WADems2018 https://t.co/lQmFLmrr7y
We wanted to make sure that voters had the information they needed to have their voices heard, and that supporters knew exactly where and how they could volunteer. #WADems2018 https://t.co/JMhg8Ic9f0
In 2018, Democrats competed in every single legislative district in Washington, and in almost every single legislative race. No matter how red the district, we showed up. #WADems2018 https://t.co/Dhhb6pVJt3
All year long, we helped folks from every part of Washington State tell their stories and share why they are Democrats. Look for more of our #WeAreDemocrats videos to be released soon! #WADems2018 https://t.co/gnQy8I0Zow

This year was a success because of our field team, who were working in 19 different offices all across the state. #WADems2018 https://t.co/anjJe7p57A
And we wanted to make sure voters knew exactly where they could submit their ballots, so we created an interactive map showing all the drop boxes in the state. #WADems2018 https://t.co/R5EInhuamI

It’s time to make certain that the voters of the 8th CD know exactly who Dino Rossi is, and how his views are out of step with voters throughout the district. (9/9)
Simply put, Republican Dino Rossi won’t talk about his anti-choice, anti-women policy stances, and he has declined four invitations to League of Women Voters’ debates. (8/9)
... to opposing a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions, women of all ages in the 8th District deserve better than being the subject of a joke from a politician who has never fought for equal pay, equal access to healthcare and equal rights for women. (7/9)
When he was in elected office, Dino Rossi consistently showed disrespect and disregard for women.  From suggesting the State build “homes for unwed mothers” that sound right out of the Handmaid’s Tale … (6/9)
Republican Dino Rossi may not comprehend that when he spends all his time in closed-door, high-dollar fundraisers. But if he ever held open public events and actually listened to women in the 8th Congressional District, he might have a better understanding. (5/9)
Is he simply tone deaf, or even more sadly, does he belief it?  Women are beyond tired of being the butt of men’s jokes. (4/9)
… and loudly proclaiming that women want to make themselves better looking in case they get a chance to meet him. (3/9)
At the end of the day, Dino has repeatedly and gleefully told a story to campaign donors and Republican Party insiders that ends with him thrusting his finger into the air … (2/9)
It’s a slick copout for Republican Dino Rossi to claim he’s merely repeating a Facebook post. (1/9)

I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government.   Lives are at stake.
We will overcome this — together.

The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.  He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.  Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/45GVHtxUHA
The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:  - Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person - Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it - Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine
The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American. https://t.co/bCyYCFBAML
President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered. https://t.co/xlLlQCHn3c

Live from our homes to yours. Looking forward to tonight, @JimmyKimmel. https://t.co/C7sRuiwDvS
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day.
Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together. https://t.co/hazgIbUHe4
The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work: https://t.co/RmcOh0rRPL
"If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June."  Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives. https://t.co/83kiIngP6o
In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.  Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most. https://t.co/d2vxUHGiH0
Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks: https://t.co/pFhYghw5dt

The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done. https://t.co/eo8GGH6hmG
The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.  No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price. https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc
As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now. https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj

The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
It has been a month since this tweet. https://t.co/19C5oY2YSg
I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.  No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives. https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV
In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”  In February, he said it would disappear.  Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”  Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price.
Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.  We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/qeNUK1y5fx
Where are the tests? Where are the masks? Where are the ventilators?  The American people deserve answers, Mr. President. https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu
Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need. https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f
A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.  It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first. https://t.co/SWU2bLhCGj
During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care. https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2
What is President Trump waiting for?   Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.  Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.  He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/du94NRJ0YI
I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/HpaqlEb7D1
President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check. https://t.co/tMBZm26h3y
It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check. https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF
President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.  https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH
In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right.
We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.
Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again.
On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.  We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.
No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.
No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.
It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. https://t.co/mFsPjmlbHW
We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.
Mr. President — stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go. https://t.co/uIi1Rxha1C
In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.  Donald Trump is incapable of doing that. https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV
We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job. https://t.co/TBpXhoAg1P
Donald Trump has failed the American people. https://t.co/HsNl9M4h4r
Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us: https://t.co/XRkIw2EzM4
The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.  The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.  Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.  We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.
From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.
The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.
In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus.
If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together. https://t.co/rardKq7Dtd
The President says no one cares about being tested.  Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested? https://t.co/WrFcgCtriA
Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most. https://t.co/J0tS9K7c9Y
The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace. https://t.co/kD9cEFtAUR
The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.
Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices.
I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.
.@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support. https://t.co/3DWCZnsnqB
The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis. https://t.co/s7tnaR4G7p
This administration is truly morally bankrupt. https://t.co/aUCRMbLsoS
Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same. https://t.co/QClURuStbV
My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis. https://t.co/KfNNRsdS7I
Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?
Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.
.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.  When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.
The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.  Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November. https://t.co/cINCXLJnn0
I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth. https://t.co/tIpjW1ch0L
It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
We need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That's why I'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3

Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days.

When we have a coronavirus vaccine ready to go, it should be made widely available, free of charge. Period.
This primary has brought out our party's best ideas, and our nation is better for it. If I'm President, I'll continue to bring the best ideas from all corners of the country and fight to make them reality. To see these plans, you can go to my website: https://t.co/8bAii5T2FF
Second: Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren. Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called "Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance."
First: Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform.
Across the country, middle and working class families are being squeezed by debt. This is a massive problem, and one that we need all of the best ideas to solve. That's why today, I'm adopting two plans from @BernieSanders and @ewarren to achieve this.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. https://t.co/FwxXvfTchd

I know many are anxious about the spread of the coronavirus and the threat it poses. And my thoughts are with all those affected, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others, and everyone making sacrifices to stop the spread.
The White House is no place for on-the-job training — Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one.

In moments of crisis, presidential leadership is even more important. But time and time again, Donald Trump has proven just how incapable he is of rising to the occasion. He is dangerously unfit to lead our country through a global health challenge. https://t.co/UIIk2gh4ht

I’m heartbroken at the news of yet another mass shooting in America — and I’m keeping the victims and their loved ones in my prayers. We can’t go on like this any longer as a nation. It’s time we come together and pass common-sense reforms to end this epidemic. https://t.co/7EDvU9OM1v

In 1994, I took on the @NRA to pass a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban saved lives — and Republicans should have never let it expire.  As president, I’ll ban them once again. We will get these weapons of war out of our communities. https://t.co/4ciJQTNxvR

We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic. That starts with universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable.  I've beaten the gun lobby twice — and I'll do it again as president.
We fall into the same pattern every time: a senseless act of violence occurs, politicians offer “thoughts and prayers,” and calls for reform fade away until the next tragedy inevitably occurs.  I’m sick and tired of saying “enough is enough.” We can’t go on like this any longer.
Last night’s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history — where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.
It’s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don’t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.  That’s the choice my administration will give every American — and we’ll do it without raising middle class taxes. https://t.co/pQ8LjknasW

.@AndrewYang is a leading voice about the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. He brought fun and new ideas to the race. I'm grateful for it, and hope we hear more from him regarding how to ensure workers succeed in an era of increasing automation.
Under Donald Trump:  - Job growth has slowed - Manufacturing is worse off - Income inequality is higher than ever  He is squandering the growing Obama-Biden economy that he inherited — just like he has squandered everything else that he has inherited in his life.
I'm looking forward to seeing @MichaelBennet continue the fight to unify our nation, and beat Donald Trump, in the Senate — Coloradans are lucky to have him in their corner.
We need a president who chooses unity over division. If we come together and unite this country, there’s nothing we can’t do.
Nobody told me the road would be easy, but together we can and will win. https://t.co/vVtykPfJse

President Mandela was no ordinary man. When he stepped out of prison 30 years ago today, he immediately resumed his life's work to end apartheid. He showed us that trust and reconciliation are possible, delivering justice for his people.

Let's be clear: Donald Trump's Muslim ban was never about safety — it was a blatant ploy to fan the flames of bigotry and score points with his political base. I will end it.

On #HolocaustMemorialDay and the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, we honor the millions of Jews and other victims whose lives were extinguished by the Nazi regime. Today and every day, we must give hate no safe harbor to ensure such atrocities never again occur.
Selling off public services to private interests at the expense of workers and their communities should be a non-starter. Congratulations to the members of @ATUComm, who went on strike for 84 days to fight for their rights — and won. https://t.co/EJ4JglWcuB
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and we are running out of time to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and rally the world to meet the urgency of this moment. https://t.co/7kNfqn3EGi

34 U.S. troops have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury after Iranian missiles struck their base in Iraq. Donald Trump brought us to the brink of war—then dismissed the injuries as “headaches.”  The idea that the commander in chief would take this lightly is disgusting. https://t.co/Cn8Bb7KLy4
The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he poses a threat to America and the world. We have to beat him. https://t.co/yaf8S3gEF1

It’s not hyperbole to say Donald Trump is a threat to our planet. We have to get him out of the White House and treat the climate emergency like the existential threat that it is. Our future depends on it.

No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate
When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face.

We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:  - Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry - Embraced dictators - Ripped children from their parents' arms - Degraded our national character  We have to get him out of the White House.

Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures.
I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next.

We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success. https://t.co/YTwf2WYOYd

Donald Trump says he wants to end endless wars in the Middle East, yet he is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one. https://t.co/lTXpzBrqQR
Estoy con el pueblo de Puerto Rico, nuestros conciudadanos, en este momento de necesidad. Es inconcebible que gran parte del arduo trabajo de la recuperación ante desastres aún no se haya hecho. Tenemos que ofrecer apoyo concreto a Puerto Rico antes de que se pierdan más vidas. https://t.co/b4baNN7hYj

On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!
Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.

The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump’s shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.
But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.
I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.

As president, I’ll call for an unprecedented investment in our country’s infrastructure so the American middle class can compete and win in the global economy. Read my full plan here: https://t.co/mHG958wQMI
Seven years after Newtown, we have to ask ourselves: what kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs?  We can defeat the NRA. And we'll use every tool of our democracy to do it. https://t.co/gBcT7VRXtR
Donald Trump doesn’t know who we are as a country. We’re a nation of immigrants — and our diversity has always been our biggest strength. https://t.co/ziFAlokFyc

Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite indisputable evidence. And it again confirms that he's incapable of real leadership.
I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one—and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. It’s time to put an end to Trump’s shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance.
The first and most important part of my climate change plan: beating Donald Trump. https://t.co/juiL35urWH
We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — we cannot let him define us as a nation.
We must take urgent action to end Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. In my first 100 days, we will:  - End his inhumane asylum policies - End wasteful efforts to build a wall - Reverse “Muslim bans” - Reverse his “public charge” rule - Protect Dreamers &amp; TPS holders
Trump has bullied our neighbors in Central America and abandoned U.S. leadership in the region.  As president, I'll renew a robust commitment to U.S. leadership and pursue a comprehensive strategy of support for Central America: https://t.co/9CHBJlc3UM

Today, House Democrats led the way by passing a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. All but one Republican voted against it. Shameful. Strengthening our democracy should not be a partisan issue. #HR4 #RestoreTheVote
The Voting Rights Act used to be one of our best tools to fight state laws designed to suppress the vote — particularly the votes of people of color. Then it was gutted by the Supreme Court, and Congressional Republicans have refused a legislative fix.

This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we have not been able to accomplish once we set our minds to it.  Let's take back this country and lead the world again. #DemDebate https://t.co/te4M9fRGCE
I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out my bold vision for our future and what's possible if we unite this country.   If I made you proud tonight, can you chip in $5 to help power our campaign: https://t.co/c2tnkkgYBj
That’s all we have! Thanks for tagging along for tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
We have to fundamentally change the culture of how women are treated in this country. #DemDebate https://t.co/bvrK6yPvcd
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.  As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate
"In the United States Senate, I passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined." #DemDebate https://t.co/G8HYd8eFHA
Over the last few days, there has been a lot of misinformation on where Joe Biden stands when it comes to our marijuana laws. Read the facts below. #DemDebate https://t.co/JEgMfuBgLQ
25 years ago Joe Biden led the fight to pass the Violence Against Women Act and as president he’s going to build on it. #DemDebate   https://t.co/UlBIhBCiiC https://t.co/urNJjGEg23
"It's the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney." #DemDebate https://t.co/30yUe3jgCd
Joe will take on changing the culture on our college campuses that enables sexual violence, building on the #ItsOnUs effort he started with President Obama. #DemDebate  https://t.co/DKraGp9Cmi
Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate
It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate
We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate! https://t.co/V0iGMuq3yu
Hey folks, it’s @TeamJoe here! We’ll be taking over Joe’s account tonight to keep you updated on all things #DemDebate. Grab some ice cream and follow along! https://t.co/uXTJmM0dJH
I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s #DemDebate, so I’m passing the account over to my team. They’ll keep you in the loop throughout the night on everything happening. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates. Tune in to @MSNBC at 9 PM ET to watch live!
@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.  I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.  I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.   I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”  I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.  I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.   We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/m6BNczblXY
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.  Chip in today to help us meet our November fundraising goal: https://t.co/1Ll6sjGzlE https://t.co/eCGh2O7W6I

The energy at the @NVDems’ First in the West event was incredible. Folks are fired up to take back our country and make Donald Trump a one-term president.   If you’re fired up too, join our campaign today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/6KeGRJxUop

There is a lot of talk out there on where I stand when it comes to our marijuana laws. Here are the facts: https://t.co/oaoExCXud8
I’ve witnessed the heroism of firefighters firsthand — selflessly rushing into danger to help others. They represent the best of our country. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to the loved ones of Worcester Fire Lt. Jason Menard for their loss. https://t.co/Oyru0eAhgq
Sunday night in a backyard. Monday morning at a store. We must do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic because we cannot go on like this any longer.  Our hearts go out to those affected by these senseless tragedies. https://t.co/jiH6jhyKfw
I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.  Today, I released my plan to build on VAWA: https://t.co/UlBIhBCiiC https://t.co/xR6QIvyBHW
China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world. https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd
I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.  Today, I’m releasing my plan to end violence against women:https://t.co/UlBIhBCiiC
Corporations need to pay their fair share in taxes.   I’ll reverse Trump’s giveaway to the super-wealthy and corporations because it’s time we reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/ylZnO877mv

At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say: https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.   If you want to grab dinner, chip in today: https://t.co/vSvhBcO8Qa
America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady. His landmark decision brought marriage equality to Iowa and pushed our nation closer to our highest ideals. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to his loved ones. His integrity and commitment to justice will be missed. https://t.co/MVyY03Txak
I am deeply concerned about the unjust detainment of Jose Daniel Ferrer, a voice for change in Cuba, by the Cuban government. Ferrer must be released at once.

.@realDonaldTrump, release your taxes or shut up about corruption. https://t.co/u3czWLj5ju
This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq
We will beat the @NRA.  We will pass common-sense reforms.   We must end our gun violence epidemic.

If you like your private health insurance plan, you shouldn’t be forced to give it up. If you don't like it, you should be able to buy into a Medicare-like public option.  That's the choice I will give Americans as president. https://t.co/sHkmn3mDxP
Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.  Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.  Today, I'm calling for a transformational investment in our nation's future: https://t.co/mHG958ffo8
The Affordable Care Act An assault weapons ban The Violence Against Women Act  There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done.
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the atrocities President Trump continues to carry out at the border. This is not who we are. https://t.co/KhV9ds0hNy

You shouldn't be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Under my plan, you will be able to keep them. https://t.co/lJZ9fvPWeV
This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again. https://t.co/YqVaGecPgQ
First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us. https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO

Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines. https://t.co/cEgKOoVhVI
President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ

I just finished tonight’s CNN Town Hall, where I laid out my vision for our future and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.

Our veterans and their families represent the absolute best that our country has to offer. I had the honor of spending Veterans Day in Iowa with a few of them. https://t.co/ziNM4qRHL2
The campaign trail is always more fun when you join, @DrBiden. What a great weekend in New Hampshire! https://t.co/5zX5CZjM3N
President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families.   As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.  Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day. https://t.co/SQBUj8nwmw
I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.  As president, I'll take care of our troops and their families. https://t.co/iNuNHlPsg1
Less than 1% of our population risks everything to protect our country — the other 99% of us owe them more than we could ever repay. #VeteransDay https://t.co/ChF786cRlO
Today, I’m releasing my plan to ensure our veterans receive what they deserve: our respect and enduring gratitude, and the benefits they have earned.    Read my full plan: https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means. https://t.co/X0YAR8r3Xj
Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president.
We don’t say it enough — Barack Obama was a great president. And I’m proud to have worked alongside him. https://t.co/5pIZxkNxyj
HBCUs and MSIs play a vital role in our communities. As president, I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.  Read my full plan: https://t.co/MxizpNiekL
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.  If you’re with me, join us: https://t.co/qN0D1vhO9N
The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done.   I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat.
There is no denying the devastating effects climate change has on our planet — we need to take action.   As president, I’ll lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo. https://t.co/hHMvdBHLY3
Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy. The stakes are simply too high. https://t.co/3LkGwfzp6U
Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30
My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.  Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJK0u9o
A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters. https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm

Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive.

I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.  We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster. https://t.co/EahL0fozXo
The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.  Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/IeJ4yOQ16q

We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage. https://t.co/QbdijSL0se
Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.
Last night's results showed that Democrats can take back our country, starting with Virginia, and begin the hard work of growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class and restoring the soul of our nation.  Chip in to help us take back the White House: https://t.co/Z9v6FGZH0r

Hottest summer on record: 2019 Hottest September on record: 2019 Hottest October on record: 2019  There is no time to waste. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and address the climate emergency. The survival of our planet depends on it. https://t.co/0ex6xguIIQ

Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.
The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.  That’s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that’s something Donald Trump will never understand. https://t.co/omaa5OTMc0

As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful. https://t.co/5UikQrsS3u
President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price.   I will ensure our policies put American workers first. https://t.co/oui5atVxXl
A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.  We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency.
Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world. https://t.co/9d8lNoCEth
This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste. https://t.co/asV8E9gCLb

In one year, we will give Trump a nickname of his own: Former President Donald Trump.
We have one year to determine the mark Donald Trump will leave on our country. There's too much at stake to take the next year for granted. We must work together to take back the White House, win the Senate, hold the House and elect Democrats down the ballot. #OneYearOneTeam
Progress is bringing people together to get real results. It’s not accusing someone of being a Republican because they don’t share your approach to achieving universal health care. I know what it takes to get things done. I fought to pass Obamacare — I will fight to build on it.
The greed of drug companies fueled the opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. It’s time we hold pharmaceutical companies accountable. https://t.co/bVjnbAskhr
Our military deserves a commander-in-chief who ensures they have what they need when we send them into harm's way. Donald Trump betrays this sacred obligation. By abandoning partners who risk everything to stand at our side, Trump makes every future mission harder for our troops. https://t.co/2271hS1Qia
No American should be denied shelter, medical care, or critical services because of who they are or who they love. As president, I will reverse these cruel and discriminatory acts from @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence, and I'll start by signing the Equality Act into law. https://t.co/n3qFokakPd

One of my great honors as Vice President was speaking at the Air Force Academy commencement. We need a President who respects our troops. https://t.co/KjtuyqWSUa

President Trump is undermining our health care and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every turn. As a result, 400,000 additional children are uninsured. It’s cruel.  I will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has access to the care they need. https://t.co/QkI00Jf805

President Trump’s reckless trade war is hurting farmers like Kevin—enough is enough.  Our farmers can't afford four more years of a leader who delivers nothing but empty promises.

Donald Trump has asked three foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. In full view of the American people, he has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation.  He must be impeached.

I’m not going to be distracted by all of President Trump's lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. I’m going to stay focused on the issues that matter to you—because action cannot wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate.
Thoughts and prayers won’t end our gun violence epidemic.   It’s past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform — that starts with banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring universal background checks.
Hosting the G7 at Trump’s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain.

Congratulations for making history, @Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica. Because of you, every girl knows that even the stars are not beyond her reach. #AllWomanSpaceWalk
From day one, a Biden administration will be focused on rebuilding the backbone of our country — the middle class. And this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
Venezuela’s election to the UN Human Rights Council is a travesty. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator, plain and simple. His regime’s human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have been documented by the UNHRC. https://t.co/n9DnSl5PfA
Trump is only reinstating “targeted” funds to Central America. I support full restoration of bipartisan funding to address root causes of the migration crisis—including the development aid proven to reduce violence and migration. Law enforcement alone is not enough. https://t.co/uJr34kTJ1I
Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections.  Overturn Citizens United and end dark money groups.  Ban lobbyists from donating to candidates they lobby.  It's time we ensure our government works for the people — not just the powerful.
When leaders like Admiral McRaven speak, we should listen. Donald Trump is a threat to our national security — his erratic, impulsive decisions make us all less safe. We cannot give him eight years in the White House. https://t.co/DjAa3seQqf
Donald Trump is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we’ve ever had.
Every young person deserves to be affirmed and accepted exactly as they are — regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today on #SpiritDay and every day, we must ensure LGBTQ youth hear that message loud and clear.
Proud to stand with @CTULocal1, @SEIU73, and every teacher and support staff member striking today for better staffing and quality schools for our students. It's time we support all workers with the pay and dignity they deserve. #FairContractNow
Today, we’re officially launching our fall line! Head to https://t.co/CQm11tCOcn to stock up on new t-shirts, stickers, sweatshirts, and more. https://t.co/OT8NGnGuoj
Hosting a major foreign leader summit at a Trump hotel? Donald Trump continues to abuse his power to line his own pockets. Time to put up (your tax returns) or shut up Mr. President. https://t.co/W75Cn5m94y
From banning assault weapons to passing Obamacare — I know what it takes to pass important, consequential legislation. I'm the only person in this race with the proven ability to get the job done. https://t.co/afK3fdTQxp
Elijah Cummings was a true public servant, his life defined by the love of his community and a fierce commitment to ensuring truth wins over power. The whole Biden family sends our condolences to his wife, Maya, his children, and the entire city of Baltimore. https://t.co/jYbvQwZI1a
The Kurds were integral in helping us defeat ISIS — and too many lost their lives. Now, President Trump has abandoned them. It's shameful.
Diplomacy isn’t just a series of handshakes and photo ops. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that — and he never will. https://t.co/ku67EeNg7v
The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy, salvaging our reputation, and rebuilding respect for the United States around the world.  We need a leader who will be ready on day one. https://t.co/dUqxxmzuoe
President Trump — what a delusional man. https://t.co/kJAn9SewcW

This afternoon, I'll be discussing Donald Trump's recent actions in Syria and how his erratic, impulsive decisions endanger our troops and make us all less safe. Tune in at 5PM ET to watch live:  https://t.co/6hXwCuCLsr
Unlike President Trump, I know what it takes to negotiate with Erdoğan. And if I were president, I would make him pay a heavy price for what he has done. https://t.co/vv4P1q7B5S
The events of this past week in Syria have made clear just how dangerous Donald Trump is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform. https://t.co/jnV8LxZ5vT
.@realDonaldTrump, you want to talk about corruption? I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — release yours or shut up. https://t.co/5JFDINCSeQ

I’m relying on your support to power my campaign. Together, I know we can defeat Donald Trump and protect our democracy. Just $5 can make a difference. Chip in today: https://t.co/Onuzp7zq47 https://t.co/1HciZmllWD
It's time we pick our heads up and remember who we are. This is the United States of America — there is not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together. https://t.co/Ft8Hswz212
I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out my bold vision for the country and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.  If you liked what you heard tonight, help us keep our momentum going by pitching in: https://t.co/s5nd6p8r7o
We have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election. #DemDebate https://t.co/t7vkrWX0CC
That’s all we have for tonight’s #DemDebate! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on our campaign. https://t.co/tidV9ZfqT2
Joe Biden is the only candidate on the #DemDebate stage who has actually beaten the @NRA — and he did it twice.  As president, he will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. #DemDebate https://t.co/5i5GcRJDr7
Let’s put this in perspective: if you eliminate every single solitary soldier, tank, satellite, nuclear weapon, eliminate the Pentagon and it would only pay for 4 months of Medicare for All. 4 months.  Where do the other 8 months come from? Your paycheck. #DemDebate
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.   As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate
Medicare for All will cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years — and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on middle class families.  Joe Biden has a better plan — he will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/Yg5auxKojQ
Joe Biden has a bold plan to end our gun violence epidemic. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership and a proven ability to get things done.  He's banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before &amp; he'll do it again. https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/cHd98KZqLx
“We have an erratic, crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.”  #DemDebate
Three — that's how many times President Trump asked foreign governments to interfere in our political process.  Why? Because he's scared. He knows Joe Biden will beat him like a drum. #DemDebate https://t.co/ddRoalUIdt
The United States has a vital national interest in Syria to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. We know that this terrorist group plotted to attack our homeland in the past, and we cannot let that threat re-emerge. #DemDebate
Donald Trump betrayed our partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces and put at risk our gains against ISIS. This is a disaster of his own making. #DemDebate
As president, Joe Biden will repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy, and build a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. #DemDebate
Our firefighters and teachers work tirelessly to make our communities safer, better places to live. They should not pay a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. #DemDebate
On day one, Joe Biden will move to:  ✅ Eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy ✅ Eliminate the unjustified loopholes in our tax code ✅ Use that money to invest in America’s future  #DemDebate
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. He must be impeached. #DemDebate https://t.co/2MJI33u28D
We can’t beat Donald Trump with double talk on health care.  Joe Biden doesn’t just know what his health care plan is—he knows how much it would cost, and how he would pay for it. #DemDebate https://t.co/2EnBmoFTft
Medicare for All will cost *checks notes* 30x more than Joe Biden's plan to protect and build on Obamacare — and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on middle class families. #DemDebate https://t.co/ICr2E7wFJ8
“Russia, if you’re listening…”  “I would like you to do us a favor…” to Ukraine’s president  “China should start an investigation.”  Our President has asked three foreign powers to intervene in our elections on his behalf — and those are just the ones we know about! #DemDebate
A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives.  Donald Trump should be impeached. Period. #DemDebate https://t.co/eY2DAPne5d
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over the account to keep you in the loop on tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along for updates! https://t.co/RkPKbgDexW
Folks, we have to do more than beat Donald Trump.  We have to beat him like a drum.  When I take the #DemDebate stage tonight, I'm going to show you that I'm the best candidate to do just that.  Let's go.
From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I’ve delivered progress for you.  I know what it takes to get it done.
Fixing what's broken in this country will take vision—and yes, it will take plans. But that’s not enough.  It also takes the proven ability to get it done. And there is no one on tonight's stage who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do.
This election is about you. Your children. Your family. And you can’t wait for a president fighting for you when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order.
For days, pundits have let Donald Trump define the conversation around tonight's #DemDebate.  Well, Trump doesn't get to pick the Democratic nominee. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy.
Philadelphia's office cleaners work hard every day to keep the city's buildings clean. They deserve the dignity that comes with a living wage, access to health care, and a secure retirement. I stand with @32BJSEIU cleaners in their fight for a fair contract. #BuildingJustice
Overturning Citizens United isn’t enough. Ridding our politics of big money and corporate special interests demands more. We must go further.  I will introduce a constitutional amendment to get all private dollars out of our federal elections.
President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. It’s got to end.  We must restore integrity to our government and ensure our elected officials work for all Americans — not just the powerful. https://t.co/81eLH8nrvX
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history.
The news from Fort Worth is heartbreaking. Atatiana Jefferson should still be alive today. We cannot allow this to keep happening, we must reform our policing practices and hold officers accountable for their actions. https://t.co/f18kAHbFWH
Donald Trump is the definition of corruption. At every turn, he has abused the power of the presidency to benefit his bottom line and weaponized the Executive Branch to serve himself.  I’ll ensure our government works for the people—not just Donald Trump. https://t.co/oZnl5qySmw
Overturning Citizens United is an important step in ending the corrupting influence of money in our politics, but we must go further.  As president, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to eliminate all private dollars from our federal elections. https://t.co/iGrbvPEsKf https://t.co/7BASgRd0EN
America was built on a simple proposition: we're all created equal. We haven't yet fully lived up to that ideal, but we've never stopped trying.  Transgender folks deserve every right afforded to Americans — and as president, I will fight to secure those rights. https://t.co/LvcqOZOxWq
On #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recognize the resiliency of indigenous communities and celebrate their rich contributions to society—while recommitting to the work that remains to come to terms with our past as a nation, to honor our promises, and work to right our wrongs.
Our Constitution begins with three simple words, “We the People” — not “We the Donors.” But for too long, corporations and special interests have corrupted our political process and rigged it in their favor.  Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/iGrbvPmRlF
Corporations should not value their profits over the health and safety of their employees. As president, I will significantly increase the number of inspectors within the pork and beef industries to ensure every individual has safe working conditions. https://t.co/5KrOfy2ldD
President Trump betrayed our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and endangered our hard-won gains against ISIS. Our troops are left in the middle of a war with no plan other than retreat.  He has failed as Commander-in-Chief to safeguard our country &amp; protect our troops. https://t.co/8dZyqUYNUk
Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached.
It is wonderful to see Sesame Street raising awareness about the effect of substance use disorder on families. We need to be doing more to help parents experiencing addiction and support children who end up in foster care because of this issue. https://t.co/SItckU6oWk
The Affordable Care Act has been under relentless attack for the past nine years — I will not stand for it. As president, I will protect and build on the ACA to ensure every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care. https://t.co/uw7Kk16p6a
Thank you, @UFCW! I promise you won’t have a better ally in the White House if I’m president. I’m a union guy and always have been. Together, we can restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/Cmutbywwth

The devastating effects of gun violence don’t end when the shooting is over—survivors may face mental health and substance use disorders in the months and years that follow.  Enough is enough. We must end this epidemic. https://t.co/RPDUEeRTyd
@SarahEMcBride @MaraKeisling @NCTEActionFund Thanks Sarah. I'm proud of you and so is Beau.
A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class—not saddle you with mountains of debt. My new plan will provide two years of community college without debt, double Pell grants, invest $50 billion in workforce training programs, and more. https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG
Immigrants have always made us stronger as a nation — our diversity has always been our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn’t get that. https://t.co/DjftXcvs09
President Trump's attacks on Congresswoman Omar and Somali refugees have no place in our nation — let alone the White House.  A president should unite us around our shared goals and lift us up, not stoke the flames of hatred and tear us down. https://t.co/WpWikGYt4b
I was proud to work with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, to extend our hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. But there’s still more work to be done — we can’t rest until every single American can live open and proud without fear.
21 years ago, Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime — an attack that shook the conscience of our nation. As we honor his memory, we must remember that members of the LGBTQ community — especially trans women of color — are still targeted with violence.
President Trump believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.  Now, he is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it.
We believe Americans should decide American elections. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic norms of our democracy. It's dangerous.  We cannot give him four more years in the White House.
Our planet is at a critical moment — and if we re-elect Donald Trump, it may never recover.  On day one, I’ll take action to reverse the damage done by this administration and put America on track to lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. https://t.co/LP25Ii1xA2
Let me make something clear to President Trump: I’m not going anywhere.  You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how dirty the attacks get.
Living open and proud is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in the heart of every single LGBTQ individual.  To those who have come out and to those who haven’t, know that I’m proud of you. You are loved and you are accepted just as you are. #ComingOutDay
Today is a reminder to every girl on the planet: nothing is beyond your capacity or capability. And all of us must work to ensure that girls around the world have the chance to participate fully in society and that their rights are respected. #DayoftheGirl
To LGBTQ people suffering persecution anywhere: the American people are on your side. And as president, I will ensure the U.S. leads the world to defend human rights for all.
LGBTQ rights are human rights. Uganda's proposed new law is inhumane. Using religion or culture to license discrimination is never justifiable. Period. https://t.co/m54xkTraqm
Using religion or culture to discriminate against or demonize LGBTQ individuals is never justified—not anywhere in the world.  I will send a clear message from the top of our government: prejudice is prejudice, inhumanity is inhumanity, and the U.S. will not stand for it. https://t.co/HUMcFVSSfA
I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump.
Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
We have to make sure that no hospital or health care provider can discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/bVgmfgSA06
There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. Period. We've got to combat the stigma and ensure everyone has access to the care they need and deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay

Looking forward to joining @AndersonCooper at tonight’s #EqualityTownHall to discuss the work that remains in the fight for LGBTQ rights. Tune in to CNN at 8PM ET to watch live.
For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we're not done — not nearly.  We must stand up to President Trump's dangerous attacks on the rights of the LGBTQ community and continue to fight for full equality. https://t.co/Wtxpczcawj
Americans should decide American elections. Period. https://t.co/oc5HavIiuf
I sat down with @MaraKeisling of the @NCTEActionFund to discuss the progress we’ve made on LGBTQ rights and the work that remains. Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time—I won’t stop fighting until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. https://t.co/zaLAdKWBrV
President Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy. https://t.co/5s7izCLSzt
Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing.
But that's not all — he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation — raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments.
Donald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces — the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS's caliphate — and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism. https://t.co/VWJDpISjy2
In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed this nation. He must be impeached. https://t.co/ivRAqnHHZb
President Trump has decided that we don't have the power or the political will to hold him accountable. He's not just testing us — he's laughing at us.  We must prove him wrong. He must be impeached. https://t.co/4ahsVPiqxX
Like every bully, President Trump is lashing out because he’s afraid. He’s afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.  Let’s make his worst fear a reality: https://t.co/a9zec0IrRf https://t.co/kjrK3mzzjk
Only a little farther north, Timothy Ragland won his race to become both the youngest and first African American mayor of Talladega. I'm confident they will serve the people of Alabama well.
Last night, history was made in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, when Steven Reed became the first African American mayor of Montgomery.
President Trump sees no limit to his power. He believes he can — and will — get away with anything he does. https://t.co/wxCjXIubfM
To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity — Donald Trump should be impeached. https://t.co/fa14AGZdW9
Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, &amp; leaves us less safe.
Every day Donald Trump is in the White House, he poses a grave threat to our democracy. We must make him a one-term president.  Help us defeat him by pitching in to our Beat Trump Fund before midnight: https://t.co/wNHtfGmXsv
With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself.  He should be impeached.

Jill and I send our best wishes to those taking part in the Hindu festival of Navratri. As the nine days of celebration come to a close, let us remain optimistic of the triumph of good over evil and the opportunity of new beginnings.
I have spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power.  Donald Trump has spent his entire career abusing his power.
In public and in private, President Trump has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. It is an abuse of power. We cannot let him get away with it.  Chip in to our Trump Rapid Response Fund to help us respond: https://t.co/1mJbMuzbH0 https://t.co/vPYBDxo3Nz
Jill and I wish Jewish communities around the world an easy fast as they gather to observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is an important reminder of the obligation we all share to reflect on our actions and recommit to our values in the year ahead. L’Shana Tovah.
President Trump must stop stonewalling Congress and fully cooperate with the investigations. The American people deserve the truth. https://t.co/WhO9offwUN
No one should live in fear of being fired because of who they are or whom they love. We must stand up to President Trump’s relentless attacks on LGBTQ rights and continue the fight for full equality—because every American deserves to live open, proud, and free. #RiseUpOct8
We will make historic investments in education and training to ensure every American has a reliable path to the middle class—regardless of their parents’ income or the color of their skin.  Wondering how the plan will benefit you? Take the quiz: https://t.co/ba2juUMDUk https://t.co/eBrukAxvzw
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions play a vital role in our communities. A Biden administration will invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.
A Biden administration will take concrete action to address the student debt crisis in our country. We will expand access to Pell Grants, more than halve income-based payments on undergraduate federal student loans, and make student loan forgiveness work for public servants.
.@DrBiden calls community colleges America’s best kept secret — she's right. A Biden administration will invest in these institutions, providing every American with two years of community college or other high-quality training programs without debt.
A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class. But for too many, earning a credential or degree after high school comes with a mountain of debt or is out of reach altogether.  Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG
Firefighters and teachers should not pay a higher tax rate than the wealthiest in our country. As president, I will reverse President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.  It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
Abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.  Donald Trump has abused the foreign policy of the United States to extract personal, political favors from multiple countries.  We must stop him. https://t.co/5IojhccVq3
Today, I'm proud the campaign is launching Women for Biden. There's so much at stake in this election — and so much more work to do in the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families: https://t.co/ZYn4CXKuc1 https://t.co/54v5rS7XLD
As president, I will make passing the Equality Act a top legislative priority. A Biden administration won’t rest until we truly achieve full equality, and everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
A president should use the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, and safety for all. Instead, President Trump does the opposite — callously exerting his power over the most vulnerable.  We must send a clear message: We will not stand for this.
This week, the Trump Administration is set to argue before the Supreme Court that it’s legal to discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. It’s a dangerous attack on the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans and everything we stand for.
We cannot, and will not, stand for President Trump’s corruption. We will beat him like a drum.
If we stand together we can, and will, end our gun violence epidemic. Read my full plan to address this public health epidemic at https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV. https://t.co/SjcCZfVbK7
President Trump continuously dishonors everything it means to hold the office of President of the United States of America. We must make him a one-term president.
Elena @De11eDonne is the pride of Delaware. Wishing her well as she recovers — we need more professional athletes like her sharing their support for inclusive sports. I'm looking forward to seeing her back on the court soon.
In my experience, asking a foreign government to manufacture lies about your domestic political opponent is not “done all the time.” https://t.co/w8K8C17yUj
No family should be struggling to make ends meet. American farmers are hurting as a result of President Trump’s broken promises — his trade war is reckless.    As president, I’ll stand up to China and pursue a trade policy that prioritizes American workers.https://t.co/r2xsaneMlf
Our planet just experienced the hottest September on record — yet President Trump continues to dismiss the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I’ll address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing our climate emergency. https://t.co/btVh7yDdgD
It's clear who President Trump works for. He gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he’s cutting food stamp funding for the 3rd time. It’s cruel.  No family should go hungry in America. https://t.co/sy6lGkp1bF
Jill and I are devastated to hear about last night’s shooting in Kansas City. No one should ever have to fear that they, or their loved ones, may not return home due to senseless violence.  We must come together as a country to put an end to these tragedies once and for all.
Every day it becomes clearer, we cannot give Donald Trump four more years in the White House. Stand with me, and together we can make him a one-term president: https://t.co/BKuXG8A15i
And to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.
While the House does its job on impeachment, I’m going to stay focused on what matters: improving the lives of Americans and fighting to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world.
It’s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time it won’t work, because the American people know me—and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump’s lack of integrity any day of the week.
Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. It's why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me.
He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States. He sees only the power – and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.
Every day, more evidence is uncovered revealing that Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal, political interests instead of the national interest. https://t.co/NNpDITpwBV
Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and has saved lives.  We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. As president, I will protect and build on it. https://t.co/Wm7cm9sMEi
President Trump is spending millions of dollars attacking me because he's scared I'll beat him.  But I’m not going anywhere. I won’t let Donald Trump choose the Democratic nominee. https://t.co/k2YNjnlfEU

Donald Trump is the definition of corruption.
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and we must fight any and all attempts to overturn it. As president, I will codify Roe into law and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/kaJbYWcYhL
Health care is personal to me like it is for so many Americans. I promise you, as president, I will protect your family's health care as I would my own. https://t.co/BTS5MW1J7J
It has been 219 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. Every day since, @senatemajldr McConnell has refused to bring it up for a vote.  Enough. How many more Americans must die for Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take action?

This is who Donald Trump is.  A president who abuses the power of the Oval Office to win re-election, turns his back on the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, and puts his own self-interest above the public good.  We have to show the world who we are. https://t.co/Bn24RHqQua
Extreme risk laws save lives. Period.  As president, I will incentivize states to adopt these important laws to help keep guns out of dangerous hands.  Read my full plan to end our gun violence epidemic: https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/gVurhsNdlO
It's clear President Trump doesn't care about the farmers and manufacturers being crushed by his reckless trade war—just this week, 160 workers were laid off in the Quad Cities. Enough.  As president, I will end these failed policies and put American workers first. https://t.co/nwHvMTc3N9
I’m not surprised President Trump asked foreign governments for help to beat me and that his special interest friends are spending millions to attack me.  But we can't let the lies, smears, and distortions distract us from what's at stake in this election. https://t.co/RE9qQ59wHB
The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone’s integrity is a joke.
Our children should not have to worry about their safety at school. Enough is enough. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/FKVffIr49h
You should need to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period.  I will enact universal background check legislation and close loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands.  Read my full plan to end gun violence: https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV https://t.co/pEl8KBvwct
Mr. President, you cannot extort foreign governments to help you win re-election. It’s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security. I know you want to rig the primary and pick your opponent, but I’m not going anywhere. https://t.co/LZQ8W3fmU6
We’re going to do more than just beat President Trump — we’re going to beat him like a drum. https://t.co/A09Dh7Uqmp
All the progress we've made on domestic violence and sexual assault has been because of people like Bonnie Campbell. Grateful for her kind words in reflecting on the history of the Violence Against Women Act. https://t.co/tROLeoy3Me
I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against President Trump's long record of lying, cheating, and stealing any day of the week. https://t.co/ABf0robBtr
Because of the courage and determination of folks like @GabbyGiffords and groups like @AMarch4OurLives, the fight for gun safety reform has gone from a cause to a movement.  We will end our gun violence epidemic — together. #2020GunSafety https://t.co/khPWpR0FOc
President Trump broke his promise to America's farmers. He campaigned on having their backs, but now his administration is abandoning them and claiming family farms might not survive.   I will expand opportunities for our farmers — not count them out. https://t.co/8MHkvP8v6E
52 years ago, Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. A legal giant in the struggle for civil rights—he relentlessly pushed America closer to our promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all. His voice forever changed the course of history.

En el 1994, el senador Feinstein y yo dirigimos la lucha para prohibir las armas de fuego para asalto y las revistas de alta capacidad. Luchamos contra el @NRA y los vencimos.  Como presidente, volveré a prohibir estas armas de guerra. Las sacaremos de nuestras calles.
In 1994, Senator Feinstein and I led the fight to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We took on the @NRA and got it done.  As president, I’ll ban these weapons of war once again. We will get them off our streets.  https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv https://t.co/u06FKHQv6D
I'm about to take the stage at the #2020GunSafety Forum in Las Vegas to discuss my track record of taking on the @NRA and my new plan to end our gun violence epidemic.   Read the full plan at https://t.co/KtCufs5X3q and then watch live: https://t.co/xfA1mVkEZ3
This is not how an American president should act. https://t.co/qSrijMhhun
Thoughts and prayers won't end our gun violence epidemic. We need courage, and we need leadership. It's past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform.  Today, I released my plan to end our gun violence epidemic: https://t.co/rY7zY4Z3gT
.@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.
President Trump is morally unfit to lead our country. https://t.co/r3SKYqK26K
President Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.  Why? Because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.
Weapons of war have no place on our streets.  We must take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again in the White House. https://t.co/hdVTM6YVF7

President Trump works for the @NRA.  I’ll work for the American people. https://t.co/vnuXbsWfDM
Two years ago, we watched in horror as 58 precious lives were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. As we remember those we lost in Las Vegas, we must honor them with action. We cannot let the scourge of gun violence tear our communities apart any longer.
Wonder why President Trump is lying about me? It's because he knows that I will beat him like a drum.  Chip in $5 before tonight’s public fundraising deadline to help us defeat Donald Trump and stop the outrageous lying and cheating he engages in: https://t.co/I2jAPpnURl https://t.co/yWcclnx5Zo
Being middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set. It’s about the issues that matter to every American family: a good education, economic opportunity, access to quality, affordable health care.  We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, ensure everyone comes along.
Harris County Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal was a hero and a trailblazer who selflessly served his community every day. @DrBiden and I are keeping his family and loved ones in our hearts. https://t.co/82ex0246hj
Grateful for the leadership of @fred_guttenberg for finding purpose in tragedy.  We will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/V5FaK1xDnu
President Trump is trying to hijack this election. We cannot let him get away with it.
We can combat climate change. We can end our gun violence epidemic. We can ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.  It’s all within our reach if we unite this country. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — together.
We must end this epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. It’s up to all of us to stand up and give hate no safe harbor.  Every American deserves to live open, proud, free and without fear. https://t.co/zdfQYpEpbZ
Let’s be clear, this attack is designed to weaken our unions and take away workers’ voices on the job. It’s wrong. I stand with Alaska’s public employees. https://t.co/MbZxu1Ayzz

On Monday, $255 million in funding expires for historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. Senate Republicans need to pass the #FUTUREAct now. Our students and educators cannot afford to wait. https://t.co/tY4o2T36AN
President Trump is trying to hijack this election to distract from how he has turned his back on America's families: sabotaging our health care, prioritizing tax cuts for the super-wealthy, and rolling back our progress on climate change.  We won't let him get away with it.
To everyone in the Jewish community, @DrBiden and I wish you a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. #RoshHashanah https://t.co/vSwRbJWKlz
The Trump Administration is responsible for the largest reduction in federally protected land — it’s wrong. As president, I will reverse President Trump's actions and protect our precious federal lands for generations to come. #NationalPublicLandsDay  https://t.co/PMh0u3rvWc
We need to take the next step in improving our nation’s health care system. The Affordable Care Act was an historic first step — we need to build on it, not start from scratch. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to affordable, quality health care.
It is long past time to address the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I will take action against those who knowingly harm our environment. https://t.co/6BHbmlVB37
It’s clear — we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time to pick our heads up and show the world who we are. We are the United States of America — there is nothing beyond our capacity.
Yesterday in Las Vegas, we discussed the crucial need to address the gun violence epidemic. Folks, it’s time to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. I’ve beaten the @NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again. https://t.co/5wRme6TCoJ
Donald Trump has turned his back on America’s families. It’s time we rewarded work, not just wealth. https://t.co/AwSdIyY11l
In America, health care should be a right for all. But time and again, President Trump has made it harder for underrepresented and underserved communities to access the affordable, quality health care they need.  It's shameful, and as president, I will reverse his actions. https://t.co/CkgGpAekrl
We are not a country that detains migrant children indefinitely or denies them access to soap, toothbrushes, or beds.  We are a country that welcomes those in search of a better life—the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.  Trump doesn't get that. https://t.co/g6JoyGaHrb
If those in power don't take action to end our gun violence epidemic, we must vote them out. Period. https://t.co/BVD3V6pYfu
I remember when we had a president our children could look up to. https://t.co/hW5VvXG5vU
I believe our elections should be decided by the American people — not foreign governments.
Let's be clear, President Trump is trying to hijack this election.  This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. https://t.co/me7g8R0h72
It’s been 11 days since @UAW workers started their strike to fight for higher wages, good benefits, and their fair share of the profits. It’s time for GM to come to the bargaining table with a fair offer that ends the strike and gets its workers back on the job. https://t.co/rUYr35qFop
Every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care—regardless of the state they live in.  We can't let President Trump continue to work with states to undermine Medicaid and prevent low-income Americans from accessing health care. https://t.co/G55JpxxJHn
Every day it becomes clearer, the core values of our nation — our very democracy — are at risk with President Trump in the White House.  We must hold Trump accountable. We cannot let him get away with shredding our Constitution.

Income inequality is on the rise across the country — made worse by President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy. We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along. https://t.co/8aqkJJKkwg
We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law.  This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue.
If I am elected President, I guarantee you I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own. Because it's personal. https://t.co/rkH4V5sVP1
Enjoyed sitting down with @jimmykimmel to talk about what’s at stake in this election and the urgent need to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Tune in to @JimmyKimmelLive tonight! https://t.co/P3zjYBGOIk
Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent — the “transcript” made that clear. It’s an abuse of power that violates the oath of office and undermines our democracy.  Congress must hold him accountable.
Across the country, health care premiums are rising because of President Trump. His attempts to tear down Obamacare have rattled the insurance marketplace and driven up costs for hardworking Americans. It's unacceptable. https://t.co/vXNaNKXrYW
President Trump’s travel ban—the Muslim ban—remains one of his most egregious attacks on our core values. Spewing the politics of fear &amp; slandering an entire religious community as complicit in terrorism is wrong &amp; goes against everything we stand for. We must overturn the ban. https://t.co/0aHS6QYcJU
Our president put personal politics above his sacred oath. The House must do its job and hold Donald Trump to account for his abuse of power. I will do mine, making my case for a presidency that will mean real help for those in our country who need it most. https://t.co/NVbk9cnXEx
Inspired by the courage and tenacity of @GretaThunberg. She is right — we cannot fail future generations any longer. We must take urgent, drastic action to address the climate emergency before it’s too late. https://t.co/ye130EAvjh
El derecho al voto es el derecho más sagrado como estadounidense, y depende de nosotros hacer que se escuche nuestra voz en cada elección. Dirígete a https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M para registrarte para votar y envíalo a cinco amigos para que también se registren.
President Trump cut outreach programs that help people get health insurance coverage. At every turn, he has sabotaged the ACA and made it harder for Americans to access health care. It's wrong.  I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone receives the care they need. https://t.co/cqpSDxQeOm
Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President. https://t.co/XlaHbHxCMI
President Trump's actions are an abuse of power. They undermine our national security. They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard in every election. Head to https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M to register to vote and then send it to five friends to get them registered. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We can't let President Trump and congressional Republicans tear it down.  Add your name if you agree: https://t.co/rJSzuDYPcA
The pay gap that Native women face — due to both their gender and the color of their skin — is unacceptable. We must right these wrongs and close the gender pay gap once and for all. #NativeWomensEqualPay
Un verano. 26 tiroteos masivos. Incontables vidas truncadas.  No podemos seguir así. Ya es hora de que nos enfrentemos al @NRA, aprobemos la legislación sobre seguridad de armas y terminemos con nuestra epidemia de violencia. https://t.co/ps0dX2aTCR
I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s teachers and support staff work with little support and few resources. They deserve better. I’m proud to support Chicago’s educators as they fight for fair wages, full staffing, and smaller class sizes.
Amy, you have nothing to be ashamed of and every reason to be proud. Living open and free is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in your heart and in the hearts of LGBTQ people around the world. I’m proud to have you on our team. #BiVisibilityDay https://t.co/mv5vyQIkAp
I always enjoy attending the @PolkDems #SteakFry, but the energy that @TeamJoe brought this year made it my favorite one yet. Thank you for a great weekend, Iowa! https://t.co/VHNVn7lFkh
One summer. 26 mass shootings. Countless lives cut short.  We cannot go on like this. It’s past time we take on the @NRA, pass common-sense gun safety legislation, and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/U1tx4ggyVq
Wishing a happy birthday to the rock and roll legend, @springsteen. Your ability to connect with everyday Americans and the issues they face is unrivaled. We are all better off because of your talent, your passion, and your voice.

So release the transcript of the call then. https://t.co/pWD7xmVLQO
President Trump and congressional Republicans will stop at nothing to repeal Obamacare. We’ve seen how close they’ve come—just one vote away. We can’t give them another chance.  I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/uI8eOeFLpX
Republicans should never have allowed the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to expire.  As president, I’ll take on the @NRA once again to ban these weapons of war and get them off our streets.
Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us. You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you.
It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. America's workers deserve better. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW. https://t.co/QgN1792VQq
I’m running for president to restore the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, everyone is going to come along.
We must take action to end the gun violence epidemic. Enough is enough. https://t.co/ShgTkAuZag
Let’s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.  We must make him a one-term president.
Today, I proudly stood alongside @UAW members on strike in Kansas City as they fight for a fair contract. Everything that defines a middle class life is because of unions fighting for worker protections. I stand with you, and America stands with you. https://t.co/5tejdcZXnJ

Desperate Donald Trump knows that I can beat him, so now he’s enlisting the help of a foreign government — once again. It’s an abuse of power and violates every basic norm of the presidency.  We cannot give him four more years in the White House.  https://t.co/cqhkBUviAs https://t.co/vXmH3lTW6k

Saddened to hear of the passing of Maurice Ferré — the father of modern-day Miami. A trailblazer and a true public servant, he paved the way for others as the first Hispanic mayor of Miami. He will be deeply missed. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our hearts.
Hace dos años, el huracán María tocó tierra en Puerto Rico, devastando la isla y robando la vida de miles. En ese momento en que nuestros compatriotas necesitaron más ayuda, el presidente Trump les falló. https://t.co/wue61t3SdP

We started @ItsOnUs with the goal of ending the epidemic of sexual violence on our college campuses. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, but we have further to go. As we celebrate #5YearsOfItsOnUs, we must recommit to rooting out the toxic culture once and for all. https://t.co/ya72SOIYVp
Wealthy special interests and corporations have dominated our politics for far too long.  It’s time we overturn Citizens United and create a public financing system for our elections.

I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I was first elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — if we do it together.
We need a president who believes in science over fiction. As president, I will fight for rigorous fuel economy standards that protect our health, our environment, and our economy.
Donald Trump continues his relentless effort to roll back the hard-fought progress we made in the Obama-Biden Administration. Higher auto emission standards make the air we all breathe cleaner, keep us healthier—and keep our auto industry competitive in the global marketplace. https://t.co/G2scIizq53
When domestic abusers have easy access to guns, the result can be fatal. Gov. Sununu should work with the NH legislature to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.   I wrote &amp; passed the Violence Against Women Act. I’ve taken on the NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again.
Another school year is starting. Another month of Senate Republicans’ inaction on gun violence. This powerful ad from my friends @sandyhook captures the physical and emotional consequences of that inaction. https://t.co/16jaVm4QNG
When I talk about our gun violence epidemic, I’m not only talking about the tragic mass shootings that make national news. I’m also talking about the shootings that occur every day in communities across the nation like Wilmington, Delaware.  We must take on the @NRA and end this. https://t.co/O7hq93Jdyf
No one should be fired simply because of who they are or who they love. We must pass the Equality Act and ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than someone making $50 million a year.  We’ve got to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.

Thank you, South Carolina, for a great evening at the Galivants Ferry Stump. As I discussed last night, we’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class. That starts with repealing President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and rewarding work — not just wealth. https://t.co/ISrYut1BGO
It’s always good to be back at the Galivants Ferry Stump! https://t.co/5Aq57vMzgk
259 days into 2019.  300 mass shootings.  We cannot go on like this.
America’s farmers continue to pay the price for President Trump’s reckless trade war. He thinks he’s being tough, but it’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.  As president, I’ll stand up to China and help working families. https://t.co/UHhCVLetKD

We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And at the historic 16th Street Baptist church, there’s no more powerful reminder of what’s at stake. And no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response. https://t.co/b74ujQlvQx
Today, we honor Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, Denise, and recommit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse at the 16th Street Baptist Church. https://t.co/6Rjs5ZcBTl
I’m speaking in Birmingham, Alabama, at the 16th St. Baptist Church memorial service. Join me in honoring those we lost: https://t.co/dsf88Ot9Ka
At 11:00 AM ET, I’ll be speaking at the 16th Street Baptist Church memorial service to commemorate the lives we lost 56 years ago. Join me in honoring Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise: https://t.co/miqSzTbr7d
Gun violence tragedies are not inevitable. Together, we can end this epidemic.
So great to visit the Ernest S. Sterling Student Life Center at Texas Southern University. Thanks for letting me join you for lunch. Go Tigers! https://t.co/1Rb7dCYEvs
Tomorrow, I’ll be in Birmingham, Alabama, to remember the lives we lost 56 years ago in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Join me in honoring Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise at 11:00 AM ET. https://t.co/0Lj0tKQXhI
Obamacare fue un gran avance: proporcionó protecciones a más de 100 millones de estadounidenses con afecciones preexistentes. No podemos parar allí. Como presidente protegeré y expandiré Obamacare para garantizar que todos tengamos acceso a atención médica asequible y de calidad.
Obamacare was a huge step forward—providing protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. We can’t stop there. As president, I’ll protect &amp; build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
My North Star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we'll make sure everyone comes along.
Debemos hacer todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance para abordar la emergencia climática. Como presidente, trabajaré para convertirnos en una economía de energía limpia con emisiones netas cero para el 2050. Volveremos a liderar el mundo en la lucha contra el cambio climático.
We must do everything in our power to address the climate emergency. As president, I’ll put America on course to become a 100% clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050. We will lead the world in the fight against climate change once again. https://t.co/Wkc6eSZY8z
I’m running for president because we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time for us to pick our heads up and remember who we are — this is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do.
25 years ago this week, Senator Feinstein and I led the charge to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We beat the @NRA and got it done.  As president, I’ll do it once again. We will get these military-style weapons off our streets. https://t.co/VeF6tP1H2K
25 years ago, the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law, forever changing the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence in our nation. It's one of my proudest accomplishments.  There's still more work to be done—and it's on all of us to finish the job. #VAWA25 https://t.co/skyMifaxqv
I’ve learned that the way you deal with loss is by finding purpose — purpose in what you do. #DemDebate https://t.co/TCfXXL4TwM
"Nothing about VAWA was easy or uncontroversial. It took four years from when I first introduced the bill in 1990 until it passed."  Read my full op-ed on the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act: https://t.co/IKcElW5vif
At last night’s #DemDebate, I discussed my vision for the country and how I'll deliver tangible progress on the most pressing issues facing working families.  I refuse to postpone American possibilities any longer. There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. https://t.co/eBmbdUEpYX
I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out why I’m the only candidate who can take big progressive policies and create tangible results for working families.  If you liked what you heard, help us keep this momentum going by pitching in: https://t.co/btrAlw3PSA
That’s all we have for tonight, folks! Thanks for following along. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on what’s happening on the campaign. #DemDebate
We need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans. Joe Biden will be that president. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who has the experience—from Scranton, PA, to the White House—to hit the ground running as President. And that candidate is Joe Biden. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who helped create—and then signed—a Pledge for Election Integrity, promising to use no disinformation or tolerate outside interference in the election or our democracy. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who stood at President Obama’s side to lead a nation out of a recession and put middle-class Americans back to work. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who has flipped a Senator's vote to help pass once-in-a-century health care reform. #DemDebate
Ten candidates took the stage tonight. But there was only one candidate onstage who has defeated the NRA twice and passed an assault weapons ban. #DemDebate
The American people know Joe Biden. #DemDebate https://t.co/urSW35YKnJ
It could take 10 years before we get to Medicare for All. We can't wait — people need help now and hope now. #DemDebate https://t.co/o3G1DENRR4
K-12 education isn’t enough. Many parents don’t have access to early educational resources for their kids. A Biden administration will provide Universal Pre-K, to help ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. #DemDebate
We must invest in resources that support our students' physical and emotional health. A Biden administration will double the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools. #DemDebate https://t.co/bXqEBbiYnc
There will be no better advocates in the White House for our students and educators than Joe and Jill Biden.  Read our full plan for educators, students, and our future: https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt  #DemDebate https://t.co/ygmktBYbEy
Throughout his career, Joe Biden has:  Fought redlining.  Fought school lines drawn to keep races &amp; classes separate.  Fought to put public housing in white neighborhoods.  Fought for more resources to prosecute hate crimes.  #DemDebate
It’s important to have a plan that meets the urgency of this climate crisis. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership. Biden has the relationships with key foreign leaders and the experience to get this done. #DemDebate
Joe Biden knows how to rally the world to meet the climate crisis because he’s done it before. Biden worked alongside President Obama to get the world—including China—to agree to the Paris Accord; and he will be prepared on day one of his presidency to push beyond those goals.
It's past time to end the war in Afghanistan. Joe Biden has long believed that we should narrow our focus to counter-terrorism operations. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars every year to sustain a stalemate. #DemDebate
If we don't write the rules to protect American labor and the environment, China will—and not in a way that advances our values. When it comes to trade, we've got to work with allies—not against them. #DemDebate
For a socialist, Senator Sanders has a lot of confidence in corporate America. #DemDebate https://t.co/J3gnqHrv4X
The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT prosecute asylum seekers, or those coming here in search of opportunity. #DemDebate
The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT terrorize families and indiscriminately target people who had lived here for years. #DemDebate
The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them. #DemDebate
Attempts to compare President Trump and President Obama on immigration are far-fetched. #DemDebate
Time and again, we’ve seen communities ripped apart by America’s gun violence epidemic. Enough is enough. It needs to end. As president, Biden will tackle this public health crisis. #DemDebate https://t.co/ujHoQg8O33
After people serve their time, they should have an opportunity to earn a good life and contribute to our country.  Joe’s plan will help give treatment, job training and education opportunities to people both during and after incarceration. #DemDebate https://t.co/aJEaNV0Rgm
We are tearing communities apart through mass incarceration. That's why the Biden administration would reform the criminal justice system by:  ✅ Reducing our prison population ✅ Eliminating racial disparities ✅ Making our communities safer  Learn more: https://t.co/EjZUQBE2zW
There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. #DemDebate https://t.co/gkt6fq4Bvh
Senator Sanders' Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class.  Joe Biden: "There will be a deductible—in your paycheck."  #DemDebate
Senator Sanders thinks corporations will give the money they would have spent on health care back to their workers. #DemDebate  Joe Biden: https://t.co/CmnXUZZOc2
"I know the Senator said she's for Bernie. I'm for Barack."  #DemDebate https://t.co/PgloBlDka1
90% of Democrats support protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/2bJKZYS0Xl
Senators Sanders and Warren would put an end to the employer-sponsored and union-negotiated plans that more than 100 million Americans currently have.  That's a non-starter for us.  #DemDebate
Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/1NOJcXFFVs
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over to keep you updated on all the things happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along and cheer on Joe! https://t.co/hhhkT86OxT
Ready. #DemDebate https://t.co/GJXM4QRHd9
Helplessly watching your child deal with a life or death condition is one of the worst things a parent can go through. Jill and I are so glad to hear Sadie is doing well, @Bakari_Sellers, and our prayers are with your family as she recovers. https://t.co/A1K3yPUpkO
President Trump’s decision to take billions from the military to build his wall is an unabashed abuse of power. It endangers the American people and forfeits investments in our future, security, and children — all to score political points. https://t.co/CeQr87Oxcv
The Trump Administration is denying Temporary Protected Status to Bahamians escaping the devastation of Hurricane Dorian. It’s heartless and goes against everything we stand for as a nation.  The cruelty of this administration truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/e56k78Rpda
Barack Obama was a great president. We don’t say that enough. https://t.co/FLiYpg8jLR
Beth James is strong, courageous, and resilient. Her story is the story of millions of women all across this country. It’s why I worked so hard to pass the Violence Against Women Act — and it’s why I’m committed to changing the toxic culture that still pervades our society today. https://t.co/gisDYqUDsQ
All workers deserve the right to bargain for good wages, benefits and working conditions—including gig workers. That is why I'm pleased the CA Legislature passed AB5. As president, I will enact a federal law to ensure gig workers get the full protections they deserve.
Climate change doesn’t only threaten our environment — it threatens our economy, health, and national security. We must take urgent action to address this crisis before it’s too late. https://t.co/r6PYL4lrlo
Each 9/11, we remember that resilience and courage live in the hearts of all Americans—especially our brave first responders. 18 years later, we reaffirm that Americans will never bend to terrorism, and we will never forget those we lost.
La fuerza de los Estados Unidos está y siempre ha estado arraigada en nuestra diversidad. Los inmigrantes siempre nos han hecho más fuertes. Donald Trump no entiende eso.
America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. Immigrants have always made us stronger. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
Puerto Rico aún se está recuperando de la devastación del huracán María. Ahora, en lugar de apoyar la reconstrucción, Trump está desviando $400 millones de dólares para su construir su muro que estaban planificados para proyectos militares en Puerto Rico. Es inaceptable.
Puerto Rico is still rebuilding from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Now, instead of supporting the recovery, President Trump is defunding $400 million in planned military projects in Puerto Rico to build his wall. It's unacceptable.
JoAnne, the good news is the bad news: you won the contest, and you're coming to Houston with me. Grateful for JoAnne's support and that of our incredible supporters. https://t.co/MalsrJMocw
South Carolina lawmakers are rushing through an extreme law that is a direct violation of a woman’s constitutional right to choose. It’s wrong, it’s dangerous, and we must fight it. This decision should remain between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/MR1CTmA3rY
20 million people gained coverage under Obamacare. But after countless attacks on the law by the Trump Administration, the uninsured rate increased for the first time since 2010 — leaving an additional 1.9 million people uninsured.  As president, I'll defend and build on the ACA. https://t.co/qsbjQIDYhf
There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, we must recommit to eliminating the stigma around mental health and ensuring everyone has access to the care they need.
It’s Election Day in #NC09 — grab a friend and get out and vote for @McCreadyForNC. Polls are open until 7:30 PM, and you can find your polling place here: https://t.co/ZP5Ummu2Jw
I support @McCreadyForNC because of his honorable service to our nation &amp; because of his values: he'll fight to protect North Carolinian’s health care &amp; take on prescription drug companies.  If his opponent has his way, 44,000 people in #NC09 stand to lose their health coverage.
We’ve got to choose science over fantasy — and that starts with getting rid of this administration. https://t.co/WBNfsLIF80
Every American deserves to retire with dignity. But today, too many people — especially older Americans — cannot afford their prescription drugs. I sat down with AARP to discuss how I’ll stand up to the abuse of power by drug corporations and lower costs for Americans. https://t.co/5v7JmFze5b
I’m still fired up from the incredible energy at the #NHDems2020 convention. Thank you to everyone from @TeamJoe who came out to show your support! https://t.co/TEJCpZLX9v
Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas, leaving nearly 70,000 people homeless. It’s our moral responsibility to do everything we can to help Bahamians — not turn them away.  This isn’t who we are. https://t.co/RLRAVHo1Od
With Congress back in session, passing gun safety legislation should be the first order of business. It’s past time for Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take concrete action to end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/S8GSiYmrVe
Young Americans are especially worried about climate change and know it is not just a domestic priority — it's a foreign policy one. I agree. And I'm ready to tackle this on day one. https://t.co/evUnnqUCoS https://t.co/vMgLVZlv5R
I’m inspired by John and grateful for his support. My message to him is clear: never give up and never let it define you. https://t.co/y7Lo8whWOa
Mexico isn’t paying for the wall. American military families are.   China isn’t paying for the tariffs. American farmers and manufacturers are.   The American people continue to foot the bill for President Trump’s senseless political games.
The deadliest mass shootings all have one thing in common: assault weapons.  It’s past time we get these weapons of war off our streets. I’ve banned them before, and I’ll ban them again in the White House. https://t.co/iyKWqhyIIz
As president, I’ll invest in our K-12 schools to eliminate the funding gap between majority white and non-white districts, and rich and poor districts. No child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, or race. https://t.co/hHruW4f2BZ
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are.   We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And truth over lies.   #NHDems2020 https://t.co/wClqhO5xO8
Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage for the 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.  President Trump wants to gut the ACA and tear that protection away. We can’t forget that.
It's time we reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/5VHINGqBxu
The @TeamJoe energy outside of the #NHDems2020 convention was incredible! https://t.co/rIeRpyyqZD

Thank you to everyone who joined us in Laconia and New Castle. As I discussed this evening, we’ve got to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic. That starts with passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. https://t.co/4MR5KuQrDd
Las políticas de inmigración del presidente Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana y todo lo que representamos como nación. Por esto hay que acabar con ellas. https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
President Trump’s immigration policies are an assault on human dignity and everything we stand for as a nation. We must end them. https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we have not been able to accomplish once we set our minds to it.  Together, we can and will meet the challenge of this climate emergency. https://t.co/tiLZIyMRgQ
The Iran Deal put Iran's nuclear program in a box. Trump walked away from the deal, and now Iran is advancing its program. This is another reminder that Trump's manufactured crisis is making the U.S., the region, and our world less safe. https://t.co/KXD7Bdb5kU
The fight against cancer is personal for me — like it is for so many Americans. It’s why I’m committed to ending cancer as we know it. https://t.co/NAsBNU0j6l
America has stood as a beacon of hope for generations. Now, President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of those fleeing persecution. It's cruel and damages our global standing.  I'll ensure we meet our responsibility as a nation to the world's most vulnerable people. https://t.co/KjBkGlBPpu
We all have a responsibility to stand up and speak out when we see abuse of power. Silence is complicity. https://t.co/y03WGsYigi
President Trump stokes the flames of hatred, coddles white nationalists with messages of support, and preys on our deepest divisions. If we give him four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can’t let that happen.
I always enjoy sitting down to chat with my friend @StephenAtHome. Check out a few of my favorite moments from the interview. https://t.co/723faRbi6A
President Trump is dead wrong on climate change. We’ve got to choose science over fantasy and treat it like the existential threat that it is.  As president, I would rally the world to take unprecedented action. There would be no empty chair at the G-7. https://t.co/QvLCIM39oV
Hace dos años, el presidente Trump intentó terminar con DACA, obligando a nuestros DREAMers a vivir con miedo y caos. Es cruel.  Los soñadores son estadounidenses. Es hora de que el Congreso cumpla con nuestra promesa y les proporcione un camino hacia la ciudadanía.
Two years ago, President Trump attempted to end DACA—throwing lives into chaos &amp; forcing our DREAMers to live in fear as the Supreme Court decides their fate. It's cruel.   DREAMers are Americans. It's time for Congress to keep our promise to them &amp; provide a path to citizenship.
Despite what the @NRA says, the assault weapons ban that @SenFeinstein and I championed worked. It saved lives.   I’ll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. We will get these weapons of war off our streets. https://t.co/KpXXPzjYjJ
Last night, @StephenAtHome asked me what the defining factor was in my decision to run for president. My answer was clear: Charlottesville. https://t.co/NN335Bxsvk

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/aXvhwUDHMq
That’s all we have for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
Joe Biden grounded his plan in the science — in what the world’s leading climatologists and the UN tells us we need to achieve. It provides a comprehensive path forward on how to address the most pressing issue of our time. https://t.co/evUnnqUCoS
Under Joe Biden’s plan for a clean energy revolution and environmental justice, we will:   ✅ Achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050 ✅ Rejoin the #ParisAgreement on day one and rally the world to go further ✅ Stand up to polluters  #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/7UP1GoZYUv
President Trump continues to:  🔴 Deny the science in front of his own eyes 🔴 Attack the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration 🔴 Spew lies like “windmills cause cancer”  Defeating him is essential to making any progress on climate change. #ClimateTownHall
Climate change is an urgent threat to our environment, health, economy, and national security. There’s no time for on-the-job training. We need a leader who is ready on day one — and that’s Joe Biden. #ClimateTownHall
The clean energy economy of the future presents an enormous opportunity. President Biden will create 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class in communities across the country. #ClimateTownHall
The Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two core truths:  1️⃣ This is an existential crisis requiring immediate, ambitious action. 2️⃣ Our environment and economy are connected.  #ClimateTownHall
If Joe Biden was president, there would be no empty chair at the G-7. #ClimateTownHall
We can't turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines.  Biden will right these wrongs and stand up to fossil fuel companies  who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.
Here’s the deal: Joe Biden introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate, and he’s been at the forefront of the fight ever since.  Don’t just take our word for it, @PolitiFact called Joe Biden a climate change pioneer. #ClimateTownHall  https://t.co/xti5vounyv
On day one as president, Joe Biden will take action to put the United States on track to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050  Because action on climate change can’t wait. #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/YWw0tFodt2
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall. We’ll keep you updated as Joe Biden takes the stage to discuss his plans to combat climate change.
Tune in to the @colbertlateshow tonight at 11:35 PM ET! https://t.co/tkNbnttzMF
For too long, partisan gerrymandering has allowed politicians to rig the political process and draw districts in their favor. Voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around. https://t.co/RrJvJMcNyR

President Trump promised Mexico would pay for his border wall. That was never going to happen. And now he’s raiding billions from our military to pay for it.  https://t.co/9sBLAZysdB
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough.  As president, I’ll name a Secretary of Education who is actually an educator.
If those in power fail to take action on gun safety reform we must vote them out. Period. https://t.co/xTEzC634Ca
This is an important step by Walmart, but we must go further. If we want to end our gun violence epidemic, we must start by passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  It's your turn to act, Senate Republicans. https://t.co/mQvtAJgRei
As I told Pauline yesterday in Iowa, if there are any angels in heaven, they are all nurses. https://t.co/A3rYhsGzok

Say thank you—because these are the people who make America run. Not the Wall Street bankers. Not the CEOs or hedge fund managers. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Say thank you to the people who build our roads and bridges. Keep our water systems working. Teach our kids and take care of the sick among us. Race into our burning buildings. Grow our food, build our cars, and pick up the garbage off our streets.
This Labor Day, when you cross paths with someone working a job that makes your day-to-day life better—and I promise you, it will happen many times today—tell them "thank you."   Tell them you appreciate the work that they do. That it matters to you, and to your community.
This Labor Day, we celebrate the battles waged and victories won by organized labor. Unions built the great American middle class, and it’s time we recognize that.  I promise you if I’m elected president, unions will have no stronger champion in the White House. https://t.co/u8kcyq5zBg
Together, we will beat the @NRA. We will end this gun violence epidemic.
It has been 186 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill.    @Senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and the Senate should pass it immediately.   Lives are at stake.
Les Gelb was a giant of American foreign policy, and several generations of thinkers and policy makers owe their success to Les' mentorship and intellectual generosity. @DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to Judy, Adam, Caroline, Alison and all his grandchildren.
Yesterday, a 17-month-old was shot on our streets.    It’s past time we take on the @NRA, pass gun safety reform, and end this epidemic once and for all. We simply cannot go on like this. https://t.co/Gih4m5iUFm
I’m heartbroken, sickened, &amp; angry. Weeks after the horror in El Paso, another community in Texas has been terrorized by gun violence. Enough. We must end this epidemic.  @DrBiden &amp; I send our thoughts to those affected &amp; thank our law enforcement who responded at great risk.
Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ coverage until age 26.  We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it.
On Thursday, 10-year-old Marcus asked me an important question about President Trump. https://t.co/AJeUAXW5ST
Like all bullies, President Trump is trying to make himself seem stronger by picking on the most vulnerable among us — but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer were off-limits.   He is morally unfit to lead this country. https://t.co/nmG7dEwr6Q
@GovernorBullock Thanks for the recommendation, @GovernorBullock! I’d love to try it next time I’m in Decorah.

Our cash bail system disproportionately harms low-income folks and criminalizes poverty. It’s wrong.

I can’t believe I have to say this: We should not deport children seeking treatment in the U.S. for life-threatening illnesses. https://t.co/7ng4vwHHKg
Esta no es solo una campaña para vencer a Donald Trump - es un movimiento basado en los valores que definen nuestra nación: la honestidad, la decencia, y el tratar a todos con dignidad y respeto, mientras le damos la espalda al odio. Eso es lo que somos como estadounidenses.
This can’t just be a campaign to beat Donald Trump. This has to be a movement grounded in the values and ideals that define our nation best: honesty, decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and giving hate no safe harbor.  That’s who we are as Americans.
Como tantos otros han dicho, la crueldad es su meta. Es su única meta, y es lo único que tienen para postularse: el miedo, la ira, la división y la crueldad. Debemos restaurar el alma de nuestra nación.
No hay justificación para traumatizar aún más a los niños enfermos en sus momentos más vulnerables. Como todo abusón, Trump está acosando a los más débiles, pero atacar a niños con cáncer y fibrosis quística es intolerable.
No sabemos ya qué decir para condenar la inhumanidad de esta administración que arranca niños de los brazos de sus padres y acosa a las familias en sus vecindarios. Ahora deportará a niños que están recibiendo tratamientos de vida o muerte por afecciones graves.
President Trump has found his newest target — sick children. It's sinful. https://t.co/dgFT0vNbYC
Grateful to everyone who attended our town hall at Clinton College. As I discussed this morning, we need to stand up to President Trump’s constant attacks on immigrants and end his inhumane policies. We’re stronger because of our diversity — not in spite of it. https://t.co/yo7IxNVI3K
If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, the planet may never recover. https://t.co/h2N0hn6k6L
Hello, Clinton College! https://t.co/luc3BkRo3M
It wasn't a setup, I swear. https://t.co/j3lpThTrWh
As so many others have said, cruelty is their point. It is their only point, and it’s all they have to run on: fear, anger, division, and cruelty. We must restore the soul of our nation.
There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable. Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys—but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits.
We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.
Our military families sacrifice everything in service to our nation. And today, the Trump Administration revoked automatic citizenship for some of their children.   It's reprehensible and cruel. As president, I'll reverse it immediately. https://t.co/WgizSndgMF
Wrapped up our day at Limestone College. I enjoyed hearing from students about the need to reform our criminal justice system and get assault weapons off our streets. I know with these young folks at the helm, America's best days still lie ahead. https://t.co/nJYx1zzlsJ
.@SenGillibrand ran a strong, courageous campaign. From championing gender equality to fighting dark money in politics—Senator Gillibrand is always willing to take on the tough fights we face. I know the senator will ensure these issues stay at the center of the national debate. https://t.co/Yhvy8MpALI
56 years ago, the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech changed the course of history. As we mark the anniversary, we must reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling America's founding promise. We can't rest until justice truly rings out for all. https://t.co/XrxJQe6yPt
Was on the hunt for doughnuts in Spartanburg. Mission accomplished. https://t.co/vLGPdDlGHq
64 years ago, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally murdered in Mississippi. His death sparked national outrage and served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. It serves as a reminder of the need to reject intolerance in all its forms. We must give hate no safe harbor.
He honorably served our nation in uniform and in Congress, he would make his home proud every single day. I admire Dan and am thrilled to support him.
.@McCreadyForNC is precisely the kind of leader that North Carolina deserves: one who'll put country over party, who's brought jobs to his community, and who will protect coverage for those with preexisting conditions — not dismantle it to cut taxes for the rich.
Thank you to everyone who came out to our town hall in Spartanburg, South Carolina! As I shared this afternoon, we need to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy, make college more affordable, and rebuild America’s middle class. https://t.co/Z1PWPThlTV
What kind of leader taunts their own people as they prepare for a natural disaster?   Puerto Rico deserves the full support and aid of our government as Hurricane Dorian approaches. https://t.co/yrIIbhs0df
I stood before the nation 11 years ago tonight in Denver and accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for vice president. I’m still humbled by the immense trust and faith you placed in President Obama and me.  It’s an evening I’ll never forget. https://t.co/jwxZJCEuBn
President Trump is taking millions from FEMA disaster relief in the midst of hurricane season to further fuel the crisis at the border.  It makes about as much sense as nuking hurricanes. https://t.co/sAmCB3SKO6
Roe v. Wade is settled law. State laws attacking a woman’s right to choose should be declared unconstitutional. This decision should remain between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/zL5fFjiJF2

As I told folks in Croydon, New Hampshire, we’ve got to unite this country. Because if we come together and remember who we are as Americans, there’s not a single thing we can’t do. https://t.co/97dahJmlNo
The Trump Administration continues to attack the progress the LGBTQ community has made. As president, passing the Equality Act will be a top legislative priority, because no one should be fired simply because of who they are or whom they love. https://t.co/X62KbDPTht
American factory workers, farmers, and consumers are the ones paying the price for President Trump’s reckless trade wars—not China. To Trump, the people getting hurt—like those laid off last week in South Carolina—are just pawns in his political games. https://t.co/RRMvVsHrRT

When it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table — literally. If we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact.
The distance Trump has put between the U.S. and the rest of the world on the issues that matter most to Americans couldn't be more clear. There is no more telling metaphor for this administration's abdication of American leadership than the empty chair at the G-7 climate meeting.
After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7.

The fires ravaging the Amazon are devastating. The Amazon serves as the lungs of our planet and is home to an invaluable number of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.

America was built on a simple proposition: all men — and women — are created equal. We haven't lived up to that promise for most, but haven't stopped trying. As we celebrate the 19th Amendment and #WomensEqualityDay, we must continue our fight to truly achieve equality for all.
It’s simple—everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. And as I said to Kevin and Michael—LGBTQ rights are civil rights. https://t.co/KSs8lVgrze

Today marks 25 years since the Senate passed a bill to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—an effort I championed with Senator Feinstein   The ban became law and it worked. It saved lives. As president, I will ban them once again. https://t.co/TCRtqtvg5g

A year ago, we lost a true patriot, a hero, and to me—a friend. John McCain's character, courage, and honor made him a giant among all of us. His deep, unshakeable belief in the soul of America and our values inspired us all and provided hope to the world. I miss him every day.

The U.S. stood with the Baltic States during the Soviet occupation—their flags always flew in D.C., affirming America's defense of democratic values. Today, we must stand with the people of Hong Kong &amp; ensure the U.S. remains a beacon of hope to people around the world.
30 years ago, 2 million people joined hands to form the Baltic Way—a chain of human determination that reached across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in defiance of Soviet oppression. It was—and remains—a powerful demonstration of the irrepressible desire for freedom.
Today, demonstrators in Hong Kong, inspired by the iconic Baltic Way protest, formed a human chain to demand China live up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong. They once more showed the world the common yearning for liberty that unites us all.
It was great to be back with folks at Dartmouth College today for our Health Care Town Hall.  Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election.

President Trump continues to chip away at the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration. This time, he’s going after the rules we put in place to decrease vehicle emissions. It's backwards.   We need a president who believes in climate change. https://t.co/9P60x0HEwV
Everything workers have that define what it means to live a good life—the 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety.   It’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that. https://t.co/bn4AKmIxu4
We need to take action now to address our climate crisis.  That starts with beating Donald Trump.

I know what it takes to beat the @NRA because I’ve done it twice before. In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I took on the gun lobby to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and helped pass the Brady background check bill.  As president, I’ll beat them once again. https://t.co/0KUrvjW23X
The brave protestors in Hong Kong are demanding the rights and freedoms promised to them. The U.S. should be leading the free world to rally support behind them and, with one voice, defend our shared democratic ideals and the desire for liberty that beats in every heart.

Five years ago, Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson. His death stirred the conscience of our nation and awakened a generation of activists. We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color.

This is who Donald Trump is: a president determined to terrorize immigrant communities and rip apart families — at the border and across our country.  The question is, who are we? I believe we are a nation that will end these cruel policies and make Trump a one-term president. https://t.co/u7DA2Fnr5l
Along with Senator Feinstein, I got assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned in this country for ten years. As president, I’ll make sure they’re banned once again. https://t.co/2NrD4JIRT3
On a day when President Trump is supposed to be embracing a grieving community and celebrating our American diversity in El Paso, his administration is instead stoking fear by conducting massive immigration raids in Mississippi.  He is morally unfit to lead this country. https://t.co/R7q41zefPu
The @NRA doesn’t own this country. We the people own this country.
In both clear language and in code, President Trump has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation. https://t.co/UoiiMVrCW7
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s why I’m running for president. https://t.co/XgVOF7Xt8q
We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes. https://t.co/Sj4Zio4Zbd
We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.  If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation.
So it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history. Where our president isn’t up to the moment. Where our president lacks the moral authority to lead. Where our president has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, and no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.  Instead, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division.
At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up. They led, opposed hate, and chose to fight for the best of the American character.  We don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation.
The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finished.
I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn’t &amp; it won’t.  The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal &amp; the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.
In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.
How far is it from the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville – Trump’s “very fine people” – chanting “You will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”  Not far at all.
How far is it from Trump’s saying this “is an invasion” to the shooter in El Paso declaring “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”?  Not far at all.
I said at the time that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced. It’s why I’m running for president.
When he said after Charlottesville that there were “very fine people on both sides” he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.  Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world.
The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can send our brave men and women to war. They can bring peace.  And they can unleash the deepest, darkest forces in this nation — like Donald Trump has chosen to do.

A president is supposed to unite our nation and lift us up. Not prey on our divisions and tear us down. https://t.co/qde3e7Y9wX
Yesterday, @DrBiden and I had the opportunity to thank a few firefighters for their dedication to keeping Idaho safe.  I’ve witnessed the heroism of first responders—they rush into the face of danger every single day to save complete strangers. They are the best of America. https://t.co/BZGCgzEL6P
Toni Morrison had an incredible ability to translate the everyday experience of African Americans into written word. Her writing had the power to open minds, shift political discourse, and shape the views of generations. She will be sorely missed. https://t.co/lj8M2y1zwR
Fred, your strength and resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy continues to inspire me and so many others. I carry Jaime’s memory with me every day as we continue our efforts to end America’s gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/D4tbmT2UNI
But our job is not done. The #VotingRightsAct has been gutted by the Supreme Court &amp; voting rights are under siege across the country.  As president, I will restore the VRA, stand up to attacks on the right to vote, &amp; renew our efforts to ensure every American’s voice is equal.
The fight for civil rights is one of the things that got me engaged in politics. And when I was ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we successfully extended the #VotingRightsAct for 25 years.
54 years ago, the #VotingRightsAct brought our nation closer to living up to our founding ideals of equality, equity, and fairness for all. https://t.co/JsFPLhBYHO
We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name the problem. This is white nationalism. This is white supremacy. This is about hate.  Mr. President, it’s long past time you stood up to it. https://t.co/EI0YakZYlA
RT @TeamJoe: Too many lives are taken every day in America due to gun violence—we must take action. We need need a leader with the courage…
Thoughts and prayers won’t solve our broken gun laws. We need politicians with the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby and tell them that they don’t own this country.  I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again in the White House.
Honesty, decency, hope, leaving nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor. That’s who we are. But I don't see much of that coming from this administration. https://t.co/fkRcGfJgXW
As we watched in horror at the events in El Paso and Dayton, Chicago suffered its most violent weekend of 2019.  We cannot go on like this. We must muster up the courage to take on the @NRA, pass common-sense reform, and end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/0eUEzzUCQJ
Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy. You use words like "infestation" and "invasion" to talk about human beings. We won't truly speak with one voice against hatred until your voice is no longer in the White House. https://t.co/CW3wxxTm2E
Mr. President, immigration isn’t the problem. White nationalism is the problem. America’s inaction on gun safety legislation is the problem.  It’s time to put the politics aside and pass universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/zGFDUZyihw
Enough is enough. As a nation, we need to take common-sense steps to end this epidemic of gun violence.  @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell should reconvene the Senate and pass the House’s universal background check bill. We cannot wait to take action. https://t.co/0OLqH0xxcl
We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name it: white nationalism. An ideology emboldened by a president who stokes the flames of hatred and coddles white supremacists with messages of support.  We must do what Trump won't: condemn this evil and eradicate it from our society.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And in this moment, we all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We will give hate no safe harbor.
We have to address what’s happening in America. We continue to bear witness to acts of terror carried out with a common thread: hatred of “the other.” We saw it in Charlottesville two years ago, at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and now in El Paso.
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. We must stand up to the @NRA and gun manufacturers—they don’t own this country. We the people own this country.
At least 29 lives stolen, families broken, communities shattered in El Paso and Dayton within 13 hours. Dozens more wounded. Between those two mass shootings, dozens more were killed and injured by gun violence that didn't make national headlines.
Heartbroken to hear the news from El Paso. Our thoughts are with those impacted by yet another senseless act of gun violence in America.  How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic.
It’s clear that climate change is already here. Today. And we need to take urgent action to address it.  That starts with beating Donald Trump. https://t.co/G5m7S6jpPS
In the last three years, President Trump has turned our world upside down internationally and economically. People are hurting. The soul of our country is collapsing because of his presidency.  We have to be honest, straight forward, and authentic about what we will do to fix it.
America must defend the values that unite us—we must lead the Free World.   As president, I will remind the world who we are. The United States does not coddle dictators. The United States stands up for democracy.
Donald Trump is echoing his authoritarian heroes, again—this time using China's anti-democracy talking points to describe the peaceful protests in Hong Kong as "riots." It's shameful.  When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer.
Yet more proof that Trump doesn’t care about the farmers, workers, and consumers that are being crushed by his irresponsible tariff war with China. It’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.  I will reverse his senseless policies. https://t.co/8XrVcUjUB5
There is nothing moderate about what President Obama did with Obamacare. Nothing. Seven presidents tried to expand access to health care — the Obama-Biden Administration finally got it done. https://t.co/awe0f8r0H7
I was surprised at all of the attacks on President Obama's record at the #DemDebate. The Obama-Biden Administration passed Obamacare, lead the world on combating climate change, and saved our economy from the brink of disaster.  He was a great president. We don’t say that enough.
We are a nation of immigrants — that’s why we’re so special. #DemDebate https://t.co/IvM8DOOuzq
The U.S. has a responsibility to extend Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing desperate circumstances—violence, oppression, starvation. The House passed a bipartisan bill to take action, now @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell must bring it up for a vote. #TPS4VZ

We can protect our interests in Afghanistan, including the possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging, without a large troop presence. That is what Joe Biden will do as president. https://t.co/5viTYUtn3l
Joe Biden has long believed that the US should narrow rather than broaden its military efforts in Afghanistan, and has for years advocated for ending the war responsibly. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars a year to sustain a stalemate. #DemDebate
Joe Biden believes that women have a constitutional right to choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and Biden will work to codify it. He’ll continue to fight for a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor. #DemDebate
Finally, Joe Biden has been integral to some of the biggest child care tax credit wins in our history, including in the Recovery Act and the fiscal cliff deal.  And as president, he'll expand the child care tax credit to up to $8,000 per family. #DemDebate
Here's the truth about Joe Biden's vote:  He wasn't opposed to the child care tax credit itself. He was opposed to this specific tax credit being made available to affluent people.
This attack from Senator Gillibrand has been two weeks in the making, and it STILL isn’t accurate. Let's set the record straight:
Vice President Biden has fought for women's rights his whole career:  ✓Wrote the Violence Against Women Act ✓Co-sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment 9 times ✓Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: 1st Obama-Biden bill signed into law  ✓Co-sponsored the Pregnancy Discrimination Act
When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is—and not in a way that advances our values.   Meanwhile, this administration has launched trade wars against the very allies we need with us to change China’s behavior. #DemDebate
Biden will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. He’ll work to ensure that communities across the country from Flint, MI to Harlan, KY to the NH Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water.
Joe Biden has received more than 100 endorsements from community leaders around the country, including Detroit's own @MayorMikeDuggan. #DemDebate https://t.co/Bx0KDDtziE

Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/dlyVfenQFg
Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn’t over. As president, Biden won’t rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate
As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma.   As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services.
Senator Harris’ Medicare for All plan still gets rid of employer-sponsored coverage and still costs 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan. Just changing the start date by 6 years doesn’t change the fact it is bad policy. #DemDebate https://t.co/CsBtsTevWE

Americans prefer protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option over Medicare for All: https://t.co/tNlPVLG1v8
Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare. We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate.
Mr. President, this is America. We're stronger because of this diversity, not in spite of it. #DemDebate

Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s #DemDebate to give you the facts about Joe’s record on the issues and vision for our country. Stay tuned!
Now I’m handing the account over to my team before I take the stage. They’ll keep you up-to-date on what’s happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along!
We deserve leaders that unite us around our shared goals, rather than prey on our divisions. That’s why I’m running for president. To unite our country and put us on a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true potential.
Detroit — and our country as a whole — is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing the American people can’t do.
As we gather in Detroit, it’s important that we recognize the significance of the Motor City. Because few cities embody the American spirit better than Detroit.  When it was knocked down flat on its back, it didn’t give up. It came roaring back.
Tonight, I’ll take the stage in Detroit for the second #DemDebate. I’m excited to have the opportunity to discuss the issues on voters’ minds, why I’m running for president, and my bold vision for the future of our country.
I'm getting ready to take the stage in Detroit! Grateful to have my family by my side. https://t.co/fMe99KYAIK

We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic — that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.  I’ve beaten the @NRA twice. And I’ll do it again in the White House.

I worked hard to pass the Affordable Care Act—it was a milestone for American health care. I will continue to oppose every effort to tear it down. We have come too far to start over. Read my plan to protect and build on Obamacare at https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt
Since the historic passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congressional Republicans have been fighting to it tear down. Two years ago today, they continued their crusade in an attempt to pass a “skinny repeal” of Obamacare—it failed.
Trump’s trade wars are squeezing American farmers. In states like South Dakota—where agriculture is a top industry—effects go well beyond farms. As president, I'd join together with our allies &amp; stand up to China to ensure our policies work for our farmers.https://t.co/CEm0IRZIg0
.@RepCummings is one of the finest people I’ve ever served with. It is despicable for you to attack him and the people of Baltimore this way. Once again you have proved yourself unfit to hold the office. A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.

Growing up with a stutter, my parents taught me from a young age that being different is no barrier to success. Instead, the barrier is far too often our laws, our institutions, and our culture. The ADA began to change all of that.
I've always been proud to have cosponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law 29 years ago. Thanks to the vision &amp; persistence of @SenatorHarkin &amp; many disability leaders, this bill was a critical step in the fight for equal rights for people with disabilities.

The marine transit system in Alaska is vital to rural communities—but faces draconian cuts in funding. IBU is on strike to ensure this lifeline for Alaskans will continue to serve communities from Ketchikan to Kodiak. The governor must restore full funding immediately. @ILWU
Trump is fighting tooth &amp; nail to deny those fleeing dangerous situations their right to seek asylum in our nation. We should uphold our moral responsibility &amp; enforce our immigration laws with dignity—not turn away those fleeing violence, war, &amp; poverty.  https://t.co/1CVPP3sJo3
Trump’s tariff war with China is crushing American farmers. It's easy to talk tough when someone else feels the pain. We need to be tough AND smart—working with allies to curb China’s abusive trade practices, not isolating us from our closest partners. https://t.co/pY75vyEFn3

Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them.

Denali's death marks the 3rd murder of a trans woman in South Carolina this year.  Violence against the transgender community is an epidemic—crimes are occurring far too often. It's our moral obligation to put an end to violence in our communities.   https://t.co/cW4gRobK3M
Russia undermined our democracy by interfering in the 2016 election. That's a fact. We need a President who will stand up to the Kremlin, push back against Putin, and take immediate steps to ensure the security of our elections.

Seven years ago, our nation watched in horror at the news from Aurora, Colorado. 12 innocent lives, full of so much promise, were cut short in an act of terror. Many more injured and traumatized. Today, we recommit to taking action to reduce gun violence
That's what we're capable of when we come together in service of something larger than ourselves. That's the America I have faith in.
In that moment, we weren't thinking about being Democrats or Republicans. We weren't thinking about a way to contort the nation's victory in favor of one political faction or another. We were, quite simply, Americans—joined together in our wonder, awe, and shared humanity.
Fifty years ago today, in every corner of our country, Americans gathered together to watch our nation put three astronauts on the moon. For a moment, we all held our breath together, knowing we were about to bear witness to a first for mankind.

So, Mr. President, I am here to tell you this. This is OUR country: The United States of America. You'll never understand what makes us strong. And that's why the American people are going to vote you out of office next year.
These members of Congress — children of immigrants, just like so many of us — are an example of exactly what makes America great.
Here's what has always made America great:  Honesty. Decency. Treating everyone with dignity. Demonizing no one — not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other. Giving hate no safe harbor. Understanding that, as Americans, we are part of something bigger than ourselves.
Donald Trump thinks that our nation's great diversity makes us weak — because he has no idea what makes us great.
We’ve heard it before throughout our history, but it has no place in America in 2019.  It’s clear that Donald Trump is trying to divide us by race and gender. It’s immoral. Our children are listening.
Four days ago, the President of the United States suggested that four elected members of Congress, all women of color, ought to "go back" to the countries "from which they came." And every day since he has repeated this ugly, racist refrain.
During Beau’s fight with glioblastoma, we learned about the incredible breakthroughs made in cancer treatment — and those that are right over the horizon. This is a fight we can't postpone. I know — with the power of America’s best minds — we can end cancer as we know it. #GBMDay
Wrapped up our trip with stops in Sioux City and Council Bluffs, where we discussed our new plan to ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa! https://t.co/WQvgHV3P2f
We will provide rural hospitals with the adequate funding and flexibility they need to keep their doors open, double funding for community health centers, and expand the pipeline of rural health care providers.
Rural health care will be a top priority in the Biden administration. Under our plan, rural hospitals won’t be threatened by having to get by on low Medicare reimbursement rates for all.
A Biden administration will help rural communities fully access federal resources and tackle persistent poverty in rural America.
We will pursue a trade policy that works for American farmers, transform our agriculture sector, triple funding for rural broadband, and bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs to rural America.
My plan recognizes how much rural communities contribute to this nation and how much they’ve been hurt by this president’s damaging policies. We are going to build a pathway to the middle class for rural Americans, in rural America.
Rural communities power our nation. They feed our bodies and fuel our engines. A healthy, vibrant rural America is essential to the success of our country. That’s why I released my plan for rural America: https://t.co/RkAm1wJJcI https://t.co/9Xdg0WduPO
In a Biden administration, we’ll give people the choice to buy into a public option like Medicare. That’s the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage.  Read our full plan here: https://t.co/RIhlOd6xBG https://t.co/i117zqACNJ

President Trump’s entire re-election strategy is based on fear and hatred of migrants — this is just the latest example.  We can enforce our immigration laws with dignity — and fix the asylum system so that it is both fair to those who need protection and deters those who do not.
Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Now President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of children and families fleeing war, poverty, and violence.  It’s cruel. It’s not who we are. https://t.co/luIZlx1UcZ

The Affordable Care Act was a historic achievement. 20 million Americans gained coverage. Over 100 million with pre-existing conditions finally got protection. We can’t tear it down.  So today, I’m releasing my plan to Protect &amp; Build on Obamacare: https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8 https://t.co/laDUcIhRjM
A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your child in the eye and say everything is going to be ok. But far too many people today can’t do that.

No army on earth can match how the electric idea of liberty passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures—how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents.

The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately.
We can’t tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right—not a privilege.  As president, I’ll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need.
The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid — giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance.

Every year on the #FourthOfJuly, presidents, elected leaders, and everyday Americans come together at parades, bbqs, and baseball games to celebrate humankind’s highest ideal — liberty. That’s what we’re celebrating today in Iowa.
Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.  Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn’t get it.
What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
As I celebrate today with friends &amp; family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn’t lived up to that promise for most people—but we’ve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality &amp; liberty for all.
We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.  That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty.
It’s not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself — we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants.
We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today—in America and around the world—to question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.  It’s not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well.
My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity — not just for our own children, but all our children.
But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is “not the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.” Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored — by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty.
And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment.
243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal.
It’s fitting that we’re celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning’s #FourthOfJuly parade — it was great to see so many supporters! https://t.co/tEOXY8wLAn
America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.  That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly

But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all.
It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better.
The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination.
It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all.
The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear.

Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.  Everything this president does is backwards.
Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results.
And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb.
Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage.
Diplomacy is important, but diplomacy requires a strategy, a process, and competent leadership to deliver. After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea.
In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended.
Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing.
President Trump’s failure to lead on the climate crisis is inexcusable — it endangers the future of our country and planet.  As president, I’ll rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. https://t.co/CSABVSltRW

I’m about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate
We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you’ll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at https://t.co/FiM7U862fT. Let’s get to work.
We can do all this and more – all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions. https://t.co/Tg2yqpL8DO
We have to transform education. We’ll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools. https://t.co/6oqEuc5N8Q
Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge.
We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future.
The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.
We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.  Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief.
In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.
From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.  I work for you — not any industry. https://t.co/f8HxB89F9V

Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy.
Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation.
Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.

What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies.
Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.  By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.
But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.
He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations.
America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black.
Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it.
President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.  Join our team today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections.   We’re better than this.
Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world.  Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad.
Just look at his tax plan.  As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/byDWQAumwg
Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it.
Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:
For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.  We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality. https://t.co/aCoWE0hggC

It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.
Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it.
I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote.
I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV
I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.  That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage.
I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum.
Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent.
Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into "Mother Emanuel" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.
7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.  DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them.
Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile!   As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv
As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father.

This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.  We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth.
In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.  Read the plan here: https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt

The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.
This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.  That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/Zw7DKYXc1h https://t.co/3NGezt58hx

President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.  The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it.
Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve.   Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs. https://t.co/AHvAupqIyc
Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic.
Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr
President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.

We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.  The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe
He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe

I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again.
We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to:  - Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check. - Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America.
Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code.
Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died.
Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice.
75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance.

China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world.
Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
Making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels, but I know we can meet this challenge.  Because this is what America does best—solving big problems, with big ideas. If you agree, please sign your name here: https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ

Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity. It’s on all of us to stand up and speak out. America is a nation of immigrants. We must guarantee everyone's treated with dignity.

My dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn’t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.  But he was not alone. This story isn’t unique to the Bidens. Too many people around this country have had to make that walk.
And he doesn’t understand that the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child’s bedroom to say, honey, I'm sorry. We have to move. You can’t go back to your school. You won’t see your friends because Daddy or Mommy lost their job.
Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.
Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.  I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family.
States across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. These bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. It's wrong. It's pernicious. We must #StopTheBans and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/J4FL9nQgol

It’s time we pick our heads up, come together, and remember our best days are still ahead. #TeamJoe https://t.co/Ke9vCO1aBD
America has stood as a beacon of hope around the world for generations. #TeamJoe https://t.co/cFPN8D8qDW
Joe helped make government work before, and he’ll make it work again. #TeamJoe https://t.co/E5vA58zhcL
At the core of our campaign is a simple idea: we are at our best when we’re one America. #TeamJoe https://t.co/92bQIcV7wp
We choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. #TeamJoe https://t.co/rg0wC4irnC
It’s up to every generation to do the work to protect and perfect our democracy. #TeamJoe https://t.co/X7YlONYEkF
Joe introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate and has been at the forefront of the fight ever since. As president, he’ll take aggressive action to protect our planet for future generations. #TeamJoe https://t.co/8gADghxGuw
From ensuring everyone has quality, affordable health care to action on climate change — everything is on the line in this election. #TeamJoe https://t.co/hUHBwEpd6y
Our nation was founded on the principles of equality, equity, and fairness. But from day one, America has failed to live up to that promise for most of its people.   We must do better. We can do better. #TeamJoe https://t.co/HEyxi8MGyI
Simply put: we are better than this. #TeamJoe https://t.co/DKObz89vo8
We the People. Those three words changed everything. #TeamJoe https://t.co/YBZQumFBzK

No one should be fired, denied a home or access to services because of who they are or who they love. But that’s not the reality for many LGBTQ Americans.  Today’s historic passage of the #EqualityAct moves us one step closer to righting this wrong — the Senate should act now.
At the core of our campaign is the idea that we always do better when we act as one America. If we choose unity over division there’s nothing we can’t do. Tune in tomorrow at 1 PM ET to join us as we kick off our campaign in Philadelphia: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/p7YbYtSCYG

Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned. This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor.
Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or who they love. Now is not the time to back down. We must stand up to this Administration's intolerance and ensure America lives up to our founding ideals. https://t.co/IY0JvqzxOU

We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.

It’s time we restore the great American middle class that built this country. That starts with making a $15 minimum wage the law of the land, ensuring health care is a right not a privilege, and creating a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. https://t.co/6w9DZZoGSJ

We must remember Kendrick's name and sacrifice. We must ensure his legacy lives in our shared commitment to stopping these tragedies. Children shouldn’t fear going to school and parents shouldn't need to rely on the uncommon courage of an 18-year-old hero to keep their kids safe.
Kendrick Castillo will not collect his high school diploma this week because he gave his life trying to protect his classmates from another senseless act of violence in an American school yesterday. My heart goes out to his family and all those affected by yesterday's shooting.
One year ago, this Administration began ripping apart immigrant families. Putting children in cages. As I told @Astrid_NV and other brave activists today, we can fix our broken immigration system without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/zYCz1PViOX

Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable.
On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us pause and reflect on the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime.  The events of the last few months remind us that it’s not enough to just say never again—we must speak up and act against hate.
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and Hedge Fund Managers. It was built by you — the great American middle class. I’m thankful for all the support this week from union membership and their families, including the IAFF. https://t.co/0utHvHuUyi
Today, the House votes on #HR9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which restores our commitment to the #ParisAgreement. We need to face facts on climate change. It’s already here. It is a major threat to our future and we simply cannot wait to take action.

The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly &amp; Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections.

We must turbocharge our efforts to address climate change that threatens communities across the country. Through clean, renewable energy and cleaner, safer, faster transportation, America will not only help the environment but provide millions of good-paying middle-class jobs.
Whether you’re covered through your employer, on your own, or not at all - you should have a choice to buy into a public option health plan like Medicare.
The Affordable Care Act was a huge step forward for this country. Now we have to finish the job and make health care a right, not a privilege, and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve.
By making post-secondary education and training affordable to and making sure the economy works not only for folks with a four-year degree but also for those who complete on-the-job training and trade programs, too.
Twelve years of education is not enough. In order to rebuild a strong middle class, we must provide skills needed to do the jobs of the 21st Century.
We need to get rid of the capital gains loophole for multimillionaires. I’m going to change it so millionaires and billionaires don’t pay lower tax rates than teachers and firefighters. We need to reward work in this country, not just wealth.
Companies continue to squeeze every last penny out of workers, making it harder and harder for Americans to make ends meet. It’s way past time we make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land.
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by you. The great American middle class. That’s the story of America and together we can rebuild the backbone of this nation.

Whether it is antisemitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes.
On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate.

There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now.
VAWA’s power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day.
One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer.
Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now.
When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It’s time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line.
I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose. The Parkland students &amp; families will not allow us to turn away from our responsibilities to those 17 fallen angels. We aren’t there yet, but with their determination &amp; insistence, we’ll get there.
One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong

Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.
Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great.
Today far too many transgender youth continue to face rejection at home and discrimination in their communities. Check out the work @bidenfoundation is doing with @lgbtmap and @genderspectrum to support these young people: https://t.co/TxMLXge8vh  #AdvancingAcceptance
There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.

Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers are working to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect.
This week @bidenfoundation submitted a comment to the Department of Education about proposed changes to #TitleIX guidance.  These new rules would endanger students and make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice. https://t.co/qEV7z3Ewpx

An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one.

It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs. Secretary Mattis’ presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room.

My mother often reminded me that “bravery resides in every heart and some day it will be summoned.” Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame answered the call last Friday in France. Taking the place of a hostage and paying the ultimate price. His heroism and self-sacrifice must not be forgotten.

We need to give young immigrants who came to our country as children permanent assurance that they are safe here, and we need to give them this peace of mind now. They shouldn’t have to spend another day living with fear and uncertainty.
When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it included a provision that empowered women to take abusers to civil court. The Supreme Court wrongly struck it down. Now it is time for Congress to step up and fix this. https://t.co/bzgD80sULc
Rev. Graham was spiritual advisor to a dozen Presidents - and countless millions of Americans. We remember his example of dignity and humility today, and Jill and I send our thoughts and condolences to the entire Graham family.
I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.
We need to believe women like Colbie. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve. https://t.co/aIE49mOU0K

@washingtonpost By denying this right, Republican leadership’s “health” bill is fundamentally flawed. It can’t even be fixed on the floor.

Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that.
Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel.
Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy.
The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; corporations.
