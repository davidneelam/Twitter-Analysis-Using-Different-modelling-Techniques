# Twitter-Analysis-Using-Different-modelling-Techniques
Election polls, like any other polls, is an opinion survey designed to indicate the opinion of the population. 
Social media platforms like Twitter contain a multitude of data that can be used to analyze the trend. 
These platforms contain large amounts irrelevant data, so the data we use for our polls needs to be selected carefully.
In this project, we used NLP and statistical methods to predict if a tweet is political or non-political, and if political,
the political party orientation of the tweet. Our experiments show that while the the general pre-processing 
techniques used on the text corpus are useful, additional pre-processing done on the tweets increased the accuracy of the predictions.
